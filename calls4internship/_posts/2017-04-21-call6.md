abstract: The problem of identifying who is speaking and when is a relevant task for many applications, ranging from electronic surveillance and telephone taping to speech recognition in cocktail party scenarios. This task is extremely challenging in presence of high environmental noise, reverberation and interfering sources, in particular when a single channel is available. However, recent progresses in the use of deep learning for single channel speech enhancement and source separation has opened the way to a variety of novel solutions towards the development of robust and effective solutions for speaker diarization in such critical operational conditions. The goal of this studentship is to develop state-of-the-art solutions for speaker diarization, possibly using open source toolkits, such as theano or tensorflow, taking into account possible issues related to both the computational cost and the training size . The algorithms will be developed and tested on both publicly available datasets (i.e.santa barbara corpus) as well as on internal datasets of telephone recordings, comparing them with free tools currently available (e.g., ALIZE and  LIUM). This research area is challenging and topical. If significant results will be achieved during the course of the studentship, there will be the possibility to publish them in top conferences and journals. Furthermore, since the speaker diarization module is strategic for improving the performance of speech recognition engines, there will be the opportunity of collaborating with important companies and labs  operating in the field.
