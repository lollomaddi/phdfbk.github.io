abstract-short: Predictive process monitoring aims at predicting how a current ongoing case will develop in the future by taking advantage of the history of past process executions.
abstract: Predictive process monitoring aims at predicting how a current ongoing case (logged in a process execution trace) will develop in the future by taking advantage of the history of past process executions. Different machine learning techniques have been applied and framework built so far in the literature for targeting this problem [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. All these approaches have shown to provide excellent results in real-life scenarios, in which a set of traces, each describing the execution of a process as a sequence of activities and possibly data manipulated by these activities (as in the case of BPI Challenges) are available. By exploiting such a new and wide range of approaches developed within the BPM community, and in particular the framework described in [1,2],  we would like to explore their applicability also in other domains. Purpose of this work is investigating whether and how state-of-the-art techniques and approaches can be applied to new domains and scenarios, such as Internet of Things (IoT) enabled predictive maintenance and domotics. Such a task poses different and interesting challenges&#58;<div align="left"><ul> <li> understanding the process prediction problem in the new domain; </li><li> identifying the best technique(s) to be used to face the problem;</li><li> preprocessing the dataset(s) so as to convert it(them) in a format which is usable by existing process techniques;</li><li> adapting existing techniques so as to make them suitable for datasets in the new domain; </li><li> comparing with predictive techniques that are ``native’’ for the specific domain and investigate the advantages of recasting the specific domain in terms of process prediction. </li></ul></div><br /><br /><div align="left">Detailed examples of application domains and datasets are reported in the following&#58;</div><div align="left"><ul> <li> Predictive Maintenance -  Acoustic and Vibration Dataset (http&#58;//data-acoustics.com/measurements/bearing-faults/bearing-2/)</li><li> Domotic (http&#58;//ailab.wsu.edu/casas/datasets.html)</li><li>Multi-temporal image classification</li></ul></div><br /><br />References<div align="left"><ol><li> Di Francescomarino C., Dumas M., Federici M., Ghidini C., Maggi F.
