abstract-short: Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) provides the ability of effectively process data related to 5G services at the very edge of the mobile network.
abstract: DNNs are nowadays the state-of-the-art approach for acoustic models, able to provide results also in severe conditions that are often better than Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) systems with various compensation strategies; nevertheless, although DNNs provide data representations usually invariant to some perturbations in the input features,  there are scenarios where performance of a hybrid DNN-HMM (hidden Markov Model) system is significantly worse compared to the matched counterpart&#58; for example in case of either distant-talking or  children speech recognition. Therefore a large number of studies are addressing DNN adaptation for ASR, investigating various approaches such as linear transformations, regularization in DNN training,  noise-aware or speaker-aware training and decoding. The work focus on methods for effectively adapting the DNN at hand (considering also recent architectures like CNN, RNN, LSTM), using a small set of adaptation data in supervised or unsupervised fashion. In particular, this latter modality calls for strategies capable to disregard or weigh the training samples in order to mitigate the impact of errors in the automatically generated transcriptions. Moreover, the studied adaptation techniques can be applied and evaluated in combination with other compensations methods according to the applicative scenario under analysis (e.g., signal enhancement in case of noisy conditions,  feature transformation in case of spontaneous or children speech). This research area is challenging. If significant results will be achieved during the course of the studentship, there will be the possibility to publish them in top conferences and journals. Furthermore, there will be the opportunity of collaborating with important companies and labs  operating in the field of ASR.
