title: Learning Semantic Constraints to Improve Automatic Test Input Generation for Grammar-based Systems
tutor: Roberto Tiella

abstract: A grammar-based system (GBS) is a software application which performs computations on a highly-structured textual input.   
abstract2: Compilers and interpreters of programming languages, such as Java or C#, are well-known examples of GBSs but many other types of applications are actually GBSs&#58 html browsers, postscript rendering engines, SQL interpreters, to cite a few. 
abstract3: Often the development process of a GBS is based on tools, such as Lex/Yacc and Antlr, which generate code from an annotated Context Free Grammar (CFG).
abstract4: Thus it is reasonable to assume that a CFG describing an over-approximation of the input strings accepted by a GBS exists. 
abstract5: Many techniques were developed to randomly sample such over-approximating language. 
abstract6: One of the main open challenges in test input generation for GBSs is how to deal with the set of semantic constraints not captured by CFG rules. 
abstract7: The aim of this research internship is to investigate how the application of NLP and machine learning techniques, e.g. neural networks, can improve state-of-the-art sentence generators based on CFG.
abstract8: Scientific Area&#58 Software Engineering, Software Testing
abstract9: Required Skills and knowledge&#58 Solid Python programming skills; Basic knowledge of programming language compilers, and grammar-based system development tools, e.g. Antlr, Lex/Yacc, etc.
abstract10: Competencies to be Acquired&#58 Acquisition of advance knowledge and skills in Software Testing; Acquisition of knowledge and skills in NLP and Neural Network technologies; Contribution to the development of a state-of-the-art research-driven tool.
