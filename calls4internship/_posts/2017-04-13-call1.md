abstract-short: The goal is generating input values (referred to as test payloads), intended to exercise vulnerabilities and	evaluating whether such payloads manage to expose an actual vulnerability, i.e., the security oracle.
abstract: When engineering secure software systems and services, software testing is one of the prominent practices to detect faults as well as security vulnerabilities. Security testing (also called penetration testing) is a branch of software testing devoted to stress programs with respect to their security features, with the aim of identifying vulnerabilities. The aspects of security testing that will be investigated during the internship include&#58; (1) generating input values (referred to as test payloads), intended to exercise vulnerabilities; (2) evaluating whether such payloads manage to expose an actual vulnerability, i.e., the security oracle. Security testing is highly expensive given the complexity of modern systems, typically providing a wide range of services, and the sophistication of attacks and exploitations. To reduce effort and cost, the focus will be on achieving a high level of automation in security testing.
