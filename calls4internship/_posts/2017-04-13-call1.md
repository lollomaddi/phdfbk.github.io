abstract:  A grammar-based system (GBS) is a software application which performs computations on a highly-structured textual input. Compilers and interpreters of programming languages, such as Java or C#, are well-known examples of GBSs but many other types of applications are actually GBSs&#58; html browsers, postscript rendering engines, SQL interpreters, to cite a few. Often the development process of a GBS is based on tools, such as Lex/Yacc and Antlr, which generate code from an annotated Context Free Grammar (CFG). Thus it is reasonable to assume that a CFG describing an over-approximation of the input strings accepted by a GBS exists. Many techniques were developed to randomly sample such over-approximating language. One of the main open challenges in test input generation for GBSs is how to deal with the set of semantic constraints not captured by CFG rules. The aim of this research internship is to investigate how the application of NLP and machine learning techniques, e.g. neural networks, can improve state-of-the-art sentence generators based on CFG. <br />Scientific Area&#58; Software Engineering, Software Testing <br />Required Skills and knowledge&#58; Solid Python programming skills; Basic knowledge of programming language compilers, and grammar-based system development tools, e.g. Antlr, Lex/Yacc, etc. <br />Competencies to be Acquired&#58; Acquisition of advance knowledge and skills in Software Testing; Acquisition of knowledge and skills in NLP and Neural Network technologies; Contribution to the development of a state-of-the-art research-driven tool.
