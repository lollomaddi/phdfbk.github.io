abstract: Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) provides the ability of effectively process data related to 5G services (e.g. augmented reality, vehicle-to-vehicle communications) at the very edge of the mobile network, by relying on resources dynamically instantiated through solutions based on Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). This environment is characterised by strict requirements in terms of performance, including latency, bandwidth and more. The scope of this studentshp is to combine radio access and transport networking solutions that, coupled with light storage and computing elements, will create a flexible environment for MEC.
