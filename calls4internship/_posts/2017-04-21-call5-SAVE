abstract-short: Optimize scheduling mechanisms in the context of edge/fog environments.
abstract: Starting from the state of the art of scheduling mechanisms implemented in well known cloud and container related orchestrators (e.g. OpenStack, Mesos, Kubernetes), optimize them in the context of edge/fog environments where high distribution, heterogeneity, bandwidth and latency constraints should be taken into account.
