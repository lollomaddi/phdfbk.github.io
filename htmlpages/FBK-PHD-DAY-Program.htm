Software systems are composed of multiple components. Components hold
special privileges to perform different tasks. Controlled access to
system resources is achieved through permission based security model.
In order to gain privieges, a malicious component usually has to abuse
a privileged component. This phenomenon is commonly known as the
confused deputy attack. Confused deputy attack occurs when a privileged
component performs an activity that needs special permission on behalf
of other component that does not have the required permission. Static
analysis is often used to detect existence of this vulnerability.
However, reports of static analysis are vulnerability points rather
than conditions that cause the vulnerability. Therefore, a developer
that wishes to fix this vulnerability has to manually analyze the code
in order to understand the conditions that cause the vulnerability.
Similar to other permission based systems, the Android system also
suffers from the confused deputy attack called permission <nobr>re-delegation.</nobr>
In this work, we present our approach on how to automatically generate
test case that reveal permission <nobr>re-delegation</nobr>
vulnerability in Android apps. Previous results showed that not every
reported permission <nobr>re-delegation</nobr> is a
vulnerability as <nobr>re-delegation</nobr> is a feature
of the Android framework. Therefore, we need to minimize the report to
those potential permission <nobr>re-delegation</nobr>
vulnerabilities. We propose an automated test oracle based on top
applications from the official market and compare behaviors of
vulnerable applications to similar applications in the market.</p>

Internet of Services applications need to cope with a continuously
changing environment, both in terms of the context in which they
operate, and of the services, users and providers involved. In this
setting, adaptivity is to be considered an intrinsic characteristic of
applications rather than an exception to be handled. We propose a
design for adaptation approach that fully exploits the advantages of
the service- oriented paradigm to support the development and operation
of <nobr>service-based</nobr> applications operating in
highly dynamic environments. The approach is based on dynamic and
incremental service composition and <nobr>re-configuration</nobr>
techniques and it has been evaluated on a <nobr>real-world</nobr>

</span>Semantic Image Interpretation (SII) is the process of
automatically generating meaningful descriptions of the content of
images. An example of meaningful image description is a graph which
nodes correspond to image objects and the arcs to semantic relations
between objects. Background knowledge (BK), in the form of logical
theories, is extremely useful for SII. Many <nobr>state-of-the-art</nobr>
algorithms for SII mainly adopt a <nobr>bottom-up</nobr>
approach, which generates semantic interpretations of images starting
from their low- level features. BK is used only at a late stage for
enriching the semantic descriptions. In this work, we show how BK plays
an important role also during the early phase of SII if integrated with
<nobr>low-level</nobr> image features. To this aim, we
propose: (i) a reference framework where a semantic image
interpretation is a partial model of the BK. The elements of the
partial model are grounded (linked) to a (set of) image segment(s).
(ii) The use of Logic Tensor Network to predict an approximation of a
partial model of a picture according to the BK. Logic Tensor Network is
a framework that integrates learning from numerical data and logical
reasoning over the BK. This integration allows us to reason over the <nobr>low-level</nobr>
features of objects in a picture and to express facts between them
consistently with the constraints of the BK. We evaluate our method on
the task of classifying objects and their parts in the images of the <nobr>PASCAL-Part</nobr>
dataset. In this experiment we combine the features extracted with a <nobr>state-of-the-art</nobr>
object detector with BK expressed as a <nobr>part-whole</nobr>
ontology. Our approach outperforms the <nobr>state-of-the-art</nobr>
on object classification, and improves the performances on <nobr>part-whole</nobr>
relation detection with respect to a <nobr>rule-based</nobr>
baseline.</p>

<nobr>State-of-the-art</nobr> neural machine translation
(NMT) systems are generally very sensitive to the training domain and
their performance degrades if the test set belongs to a different
domain than the training data. Therefore, the current NMT systems are
trained on specific domains by carefully selecting the training sets
and applying proper domain adaptation techniques. However, in <nobr>real-world</nobr>
applications it is very hard, if not impossible, to develop and
maintain several specific MT systems for multiple domains. This is
mostly due to the fact that usually: i) the target domain is not known
in advance, and users might query different sentences from different
domains; ii) the application domains are very diverse, making it not
feasible to develop and <nobr>fine-tune</nobr> one system
for each domain, which makes the possibility of developing and <nobr>fine-tuning</nobr>
one system for each domain unfeasible; iii) there is no (or very
limited amount of) indomain training data to train <nobr>domain-specific</nobr>
MT engines. In this situation, it is necessary to have high quality MT
systems that perform consistently well in all (or most of) the domains.
In this project we propose effective solutions for developing <nobr>multi-domain</nobr>
NMT systems that their performance does not degrade by changing the
application domain and perform equally well in all the domains.</p>

Detecting contrast, both among words and among portions of text, is a
fundamental requirement for text analysis, thus playing a crucial role
in applications such as machine translation, discourse understanding,
and information retrieval. My research is focused on the study of
opposition relations between verbs and contrast relations at textual
level. Through a <nobr>crowd-sourcing</nobr> experiment, I
bring evidences that i) opposition relations exist between senses of
verbs, and ii) there exist different types of opposition relations with
different characteristics. Moreover, I focused on contrast relations at
textual level that can be either marked by textual connectives or
implicitly conveyed. In particular, I aim at creating an exhaustive
list of the textual connectives for contrast relations in Italian, and
by analysing corpora I am studying which are other linguistic
strategies used to communicate contrast in texts and if these
strategies have any regularities (for example, what is the relation
between lexical opposition and contrast marked by an explicit
connective at textual level?). I mainly investigate these relations in
the Italian language, using and developing lexical resources such as
the <nobr>T-PAS</nobr> resource [1] and the LICO resource

Mimicking nature to achieve special properties is a brunch of science
that has become popular in the last few decades. Of particular interest
for their properties are lotus leaf and sharkskin. Lotus leaf has a
superhydrophobic surface and sharkskin has drag reduction properties.
Specifically the <nobr>self-cleaning</nobr> effect is
wildly known as the ‘lotus effect’. <nobr>Bio-inspired</nobr>
surfaces of lotus leaf have low adhesion, water repellency and <nobr>self-cleaning</nobr>
<nobr>[1-3].</nobr> These properties arise from a
combination of chemical and <nobr>micro-structuration</nobr>
of the surface. Combining roughness and a hydrophobic surface leads to
superhydrophobicity, while using a hydrophilic substrate generally
leads to superhydrophilicity. Sharkskin is known to have a low drag
coefficient that lead at increment of swimming speed and lower power
consumption. The second part of my work consist on combining lotus leaf
and sharkskin effects. For this purpose a systematic range of
hierarchical and <nobr>non-hierarchical</nobr> structures
have been analysed, in order to find a clear relationship between
wettability and flow properties. Static and dynamic contact angle, tilt
angle and pressure drop, measured long a channel, are the value used
for this analysis. Part of my work consist in generate and analyze <nobr>silicon-based</nobr>

Large scale emergency events may have dramatic political, economical
and social consequences. These events may result in higher crime rates,
spreading of infectious diseases, economic crises, and migration
phenomena (e.g. refugees across borders or internally displaced
people). Hence, early detection of emergency events, such as riots and
natural disasters, is of paramount relevance. Based on the assumption
that emergency events influence people communication and mobility
patterns, we propose to use Call Detail Records (CDR), collected by
mobile telecommunication operators for billing reasons, to detect such
events. To this end, first we apply the Markov modulated Poisson
process to detect anomalies for hourly intervals. Second, we will
examine how the effects of these events propagate among different
geographical areas. The preliminary results show that our approach can
successfully detected anomalous events (e.g. confrontations between
groups) at country scale. By introducing proximity graphs, which are
constructed from mobility patterns of users, we expect to be able to
reveal the existence of specific patterns for different types of events.</p>

The knowledge about the species of trees is essential for precision
forest management practices. Modern high density airborne Light
Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) systems have the ability to acquire large
number of LiDAR points, allowing a very detailed characterization of
the forest at the individual tree level. In this context, it is
possible to use such LiDAR data for accurate classification of the tree
species. In this paper, we consider the specific problem of species
classification of trees belonging to the conifer class. However,
species classification within a class (e.g., the conifer class) using
LiDAR data is a challenging problem when considering the tree external
crown characteristics only. The Internal Crown Geometric Features
(IGFs) are defined based on a novel internal branch structure model
that uses 3D region growing and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to
delineate the branch structure of a conifer tree accurately. Internal
crown geometric features are used together with external crown
geometric features (EGFs) to with the objective of performing an
efficient conifer species classification. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
was used for classification and to evaluate the accuracy.</p>

incidence of both false positives and false negatives. We use test case
generation to reveal false positives and mutation testing to reveal
false negatives. The experimental results show that the fault detection

Neuroscientific experiments investigate the subject’s response to
external stimulation. Stimulation categories and the order they appear
to the subject are defined in the stimulation protocol. In traditional
experiments, when the data is analyzed in the offline mode, protocol is
fixed beforehand and does not change in the course of experimental data
acquisition. In <nobr>real-time</nobr> neuroscientific
experiments the data is analyzed in the online mode simultaneously with
the acquisition process. <nobr>Real-time</nobr>
experiments allow to examine a broader range of scientific questions,
for instance, how to bring the subject in a certain state or how the
outcome of the cognitive task depends on the subject’s state. There is
growing interest in experiments of this type, because the community
along with the traditional group studies is more and more turining to
modelling individuals for the purpose of customized interventions. A
key advantage of <nobr>real-time</nobr> experimentation is
the possibility to adjust the experiment protocol as you go, basing on
the subject’s response. This, in turn, requires having adequate models
of the subject’s state dynamics and efficient algorithms for the
optimal choice of the stimulation/feedback being delivered to the
subject. There is a plethora of methods for the protocol adjustment,
but still important gaps exist especially when there is need for
adaptation in view of a particular experimental goal. We will show how
the problem of <nobr>real-time</nobr> protocol adaptation
can be tackled in the context of a <nobr>real-time</nobr>
Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) experiment and in a <nobr>real-time</nobr>

Gamification uses game elements and game mechanics in a <nobr>non-game</nobr>
context in order to reach a certain goal (e.g., incentivizing people to
change their behaviors in a specific domain). While gamification is
often effective in inducing such behavioural changes, <nobr>well-known</nobr>
limitations concern retaining the interest of players over the long
term, and sustaining the new behaviors promoted through the game.
Hence, there is a need to devise techniques to keep users interested
and engaged to participate in the gamified system in the long term. We
propose an approach based on the Procedural Content Generation of
personalized and contextualized playable units that appeal to each
player, and make her user experience more varied and individually
compelling. To this end, we have built a <nobr>context-aware</nobr>
recommender system (CARS) to generate and recommend personalized
challenges, based on the player’s preference, history, game status and
performance. Hereby we describe our approach, and evaluate it using a
smart urban mobility game that involved the proposal of weekly
challenges to hundreds of citizens/players.</p>

In my PhD research, I explore the expressive abilities of haptic
communication, considering the case study of rock climbing. In recent
years, research in <nobr>Human-Computer</nobr> Interaction
has shown increasing interest in the design and development of
interfaces that do not rely only on visual displays and vision as
sensory modality to interact. In this respect, haptic feedback has
gained increasing interest as means to convey information, since it can
be perceived by our body through the sense of touch. So far, haptic
feedback has been investigated for the acquisition of motor skills (for
example in the domains of surgery, instrument playing, and sport) and
for emotional communication, trying the reproduce the expressiveness of
touch typical of <nobr>co-located</nobr> interpersonal
communication (such as intimacy, closeness, reassurance, etc.), also in
remote communication. Being linked to the sense of touch in order to be
perceived and understood, the systems that exploit haptic feedback need
to be in direct contact with the body; thus, they are mainly divided in
tangible and wearable devices. In my research, I explore the
communicative abilities of haptic feedback in the context of rock
climbing, an extreme sport that requires both the skillful use of the
body and the control over negative emotions. By considering the
opportunities and constraints offered by technology, and the users’
needs, values, and motivations, I aim at designing a valuable and
usable device for the community of climbers and, at the same time, at
investigating the communicative abilities of haptic feedback. As a
general framework for my thesis, I adopt a <nobr>co-evolutionary</nobr>
design approach (Agostini et al. 2000) which divided the design process
in three main aspects, namely user research, technology exploration,
and concepts</p>
<p class="p26 ft30">generation. According to this
framework, the investigation of the three aspects is performed in
parallel and alternate moments of divergence, when the investigation
goes deep into the details of each of them, to moments of converge,
when each aspect informs the others. So far, I have conducted an
extensive field study with beginner climbers aimed at identifying a
possible design space for haptic communication in climbing. Results
have shown that during the learning phase the probability of
experiencing negative emotions is higher, due to the lack of skills and
of familiarity with the new sensations that the vertical dimension of
this sport provides. Currently, instructors address negative emotions
by giving suggestions or reassuring the climber. However, often there
are contextual problems that hinder the communication between who
climbs and who is on the ground, such as distance and noise. These
instances suggest a space of design for alternative ways of
communication between the actors involved, and it is within this space
of design that I explore the opportunities offered by haptic
communication in terms of expressivity, usefulness and acceptability.
Regarding the design, I conducted two workshops aimed at exploring form
factor, body location, purpose, and kind of vibration of a possible
haptic wearable device. From the technological perspective, the
exploration conducted has led to choose vibration as form of haptic
communication and to the development of an early wearable prototype
that can be activated through Bluetooth. As final steps of my research,
I plan to conduct a study on the understandability of different
vibrations in order to define a vocabulary of instructions useful in
the climbing context and to conduct an evaluation of the wearable
vibrotactile prototype in ecological setting (i.e. in a climbing course
in an indoor gym).</p>

task, we first carry out a study, on transcriptions of political
speeches, to manually annotate the components involved in detecting
agreement and disagreement. Then, based on the features and
interactions observed in this study, we propose an approach to capture,
via supervised classification, divergences and similarities in points
of view between different authors or speakers when they deal with the
same topic. We do not focus on debates in dialogical form, but we
rather consider sets of documents in which politicians may express
their position with respect to different topics, both in an implicit or

Social Media have become a valuable source of <nobr>up-to-date</nobr>
knowledge about any fictional and real- life entity including persons,
organisations, events and many others. Recently, researchers have
started to use this knowledge to solve or improve on a number of tasks
across different fields including Natural Language Processing and Image
Processing. Many new research directions have emerged as well. In my
research, I propose a concept of Social Annotation that is defined as a
task of linking named entities in a given text to their corresponding
Social Media entities, like, for example, hashtags, user profiles and
pages. This task is very similar to Named Entity Linking, where the
Social Network is used instead of the Knowledge Base. Social Annotation
can, therefore, provide a rich <nobr>up-to-date</nobr>

complete for further processing and usage. However, dealing with Social
Media imposes a number of new challenges including noisiness and scale
of data that need to be processed. I aim to overcome such challenges in
my research.</p>

Ontologies are used in computer science to represent knowledge in a
formal and unambiguous way, facilitating knowledge reuse and sharing
among people and computer systems. Manually encoding the knowledge
carried by unstructured sources (e.g., documents, <nobr>web-pages,</nobr>
and so on) into a formal representation can be costly and <nobr>time-consuming.</nobr>
Indeed, the knowledge acquisition bottleneck is one of the main
obstacles to a wide adoption of semantic web and knowledge management
technology. To overcome this problem, several methods and tools have
been proposed to automatically extract (that is, learn) ontologies from
unstructured sources, thus supporting knowledge engineers in this task.
These methods still suffer from severe limitations: either they are
limited in the expressiveness of the automatically acquired knowledge
or, when targeting the extraction of expressive knowledge, they rely on
sets of hand- crafted patterns that are expensive to maintain and
evolve. Our goal is to overcome these limitations by designing and
training a single Deep Learning based system capable to support the
automatic extraction of expressive knowledge in a completely automatic,
<nobr>end-to-end</nobr> fashion. Results so far have shown
that our approach can effectively contribute to the automatic ontology

Digital identity (DI) management is a key factor to enable the adoption
of innovative digital and physical services. Requirements for a
complete DI solution include legal, security and technological aspects.
For example, the national laws (e.g., SPID) and European regulations
(e.g., eIDAS) prohibit to use social login solutions to access <nobr>e-health</nobr>
services. The process of defining DI management systems is only at an
early stage and solutions capable of addressing all these aspects are
missing. In this context, our goal is to propose novel authentication
and authorization solutions that satisfy the expected security
requirements and protect user privacy, while complying with national
and European laws and directives. In particular, we have focused on
mobile technologies. Indeed, while for web applications there exist
many secure authentication and authorization solutions to protect the
user's DI and online resources, solutions for the mobile context are
not well consolidated. This is a huge limitation as mobile applications
are dominating the market of online services, with a total of 4.9
billion unique mobile subscribers by the end of 2016 (more than 60% of
the world population). Our DI solutions are designed and developed in
three different contexts: (1) smart city: we have proposed an <nobr>OAuth-based</nobr>
solution for secure delegated access to online resources. An
implementation of this solution has been integrated in the Smart
Community Platform of FBK for developing open services in the Trentino
region and is being used daily by up to 13,000 users. (2) <nobr>e-health:</nobr>
an implementation of our proposed Single <nobr>Sign-On</nobr>
model is currently tested by the users of TreC (acronym for Cartella
Clinica del Cittadino), a personal health record system. TreC is
currently deploying a number of Android applications to support <nobr>self-management</nobr>
and remote monitoring of chronic conditions. The solution we propose
will allow patients to access different TreC <nobr>e-health</nobr>
mobile applications with a SSO experience. (3) single digital market:
we are involved in a EIT Digital project called FIDES (acronym for
Federated Identity Management System). Its goal is to manage digital
identities in a federated way, creating an identity ecosystem that
permits the access to digital and physical services in a secure, <nobr>cross-border</nobr>
and <nobr>multi-device</nobr> way.</p>

Complexes in plants and photosynthetic bacteria, constitute the
fundamental units through which sunlight is collected. The harvested
energy is then redirected towards a Reaction Center by means of
extremely efficient Energy Transfer (ET) processes, where its
conversion to chemical energy, for the organisms’ <nobr>self-sustenance,</nobr>
finally occurs. The high complexity of such systems, where multiple
interacting chromophores are embedded in a fluctuating protein matrix,
makes it extremely</p>
<p class="p25 ft28">difficult to study their response to
external excitations, both theoretically and experimentally. In this
respect, advances in <nobr>non-linear</nobr> electronic
spectroscopy with femtosecond time resolution, such as the Two-
Dimensional Electronic Spectroscopy (2DES), have provided new insight
on energy transfer processes [1], allowing to decongest the overlapping
transient spectra. High density of information is obtained, but to
accurately disentangle all these features and reach a detailed and
reliable map of the ET routes is still a challenge. A solution is to
integrate the measurements with theoretical models that become
mandatory for experiments interpretation [2].</p>
<p class="p25 ft37">Here we introduce a fully <nobr>Quantum-Chemistry</nobr>
based protocol to simulate 2DES spectra of complex multi- chromophoric
architectures of known structure. The proposed scheme relies on a QM/MM
<nobr>multi-scale</nobr> approach [3,4] able to link single
chromophoric units with the whole molecular aggregate via a so called
Frenkel Exciton Hamiltonian, eventually delivering the system’s
manifold of states with an unprecedented accuracy. The level of
sophistication obtained, also including molecular vibrations and
environmental fluctuations, allows us to simulate and interpret linear
and <nobr>non-linear</nobr> spectroscopy, providing a
deeper insight of the recorded spectral signatures. Application to the
LH2 test case, employed here as a challenging playground, shows a
remarkable agreement with the experiments and sheds new light on some
still debated features of this extensively studied antenna system.</p>

The use of remote sensing in the analysis and evaluation of
environmental changes has become a valuable tool which relevance has
increased with the improvement in acquisition sensor technology as well
as in the data/image processing algorithms. The capability to
understand and detect those changes increases when we consider Very
High spatial Resolution (VHR) multispectral images acquired by passive
sensors such as IKONOS, QuickBird, GeoEye, <nobr>WorldView-2</nobr>
and Pleiades. Nevertheless, the revisit period of each single sensor,
their competing orders, and the weather conditions do not always allow
the acquisition of proper and continuous information. To mitigate these
limitations, it is possible to build time series by considering images
acquired by different sensors. The challenge becomes how to deal with
this kind of information. Therefore, the aims of this proposal are
mainly two: i) <nobr>multi-sensor</nobr> multitemporal VHR
data homogenization; and ii) change detection for the analysis of VHR <nobr>multi-sensor</nobr>
multitemporal images.</p>

Information Extraction, that is the task aimed at automatically
identifying specific pieces of information in unstructured data, is an
active area of research in the Natural Language Processing (NLP)
community. However resources and automatic systems developed so far
have mainly addressed contemporary texts. Finding new approaches to the
automatic identification of information also in historical documents
can, indeed, assist historians in enhancing their work while dealing
with the ever increasing amount of digital sources and, moreover, it
can have an impact both on NLP and on Digital Humanities research. In
this poster we present a new Information Extraction task applied to
historical documents: more specifically we present a new corpus of
historical travel guides, a new scheme for the annotation of Content
Types (i.e., text passages with specific semantic and functional
characteristics) and the results of two preliminary sets of
classification experiments. The identification of Content Types may
improve the performance of more complex NLP tasks, for example timeline
building, by targeting the portions of the documents that are more
relevant.</p>

Language is the main communication device to represent the environment
and share a common understanding of the world that we perceive through
of our sensory organs. Therefore, each language might contain a great
amount of sensorial elements to express the perceptions both in literal
and figurative usage. In contrast to being an anomaly, figurative
language, especially metaphors within the scope of this study, is
pervasive in the common language and should be handled by any NLP
application that includes a semantic task. In order to tackle the
semantics of figurative language, several conceptual properties are
utilized, such as concreteness or imegeability. However, to the best of
our knowledge, there is no attempt in the literature to analyze and
benefit from the sensorial elements for the figurative language
processing. In this research, we propose to exploit sensorial affinity
of the words as a feature for metaphor identification task.
Additionally, we introduce the automatic detection of synaesthetic
metaphors, which is one of the most common metaphoric transfers.</p>

Since the developement of modern electronics the dimension of
electronic devices, their integration density and their possible
applications has changed a lot. The reduction in the base elements
dimension and the development of integrated devices allowed the advent
of modern computers. Photonics is following a similar route: starting
from the development of optical fibers for <nobr>long-range</nobr>
signal transmission to integrated devices with footprints of a few
squared micrometers. The center around which this work revolves is a
project financed by the Provincia Autonoma di Trento (PAT) ''On silicon
chip quantum optics for quantum computing and secure communications'',
SIQURO. Project SIQURO aims at developing an integrated chip that
features many different components: a "Lab On a Chip" (LAC) approach,
to explore the possibility of <nobr>non-linear</nobr> and
quantum experiments within a single chip. The idea is to shrink a
number of macroscopic tools normally required to perform the
experiment, I.E. an optical table with a footprint of m<span class="ft8">2</span>, within a single silicon chip of
few cm<span class="ft8">2</span>. In particular I've
been involved in the realization of an integrated <nobr>III-V</nobr>
pulsed laser, photonic circuitry for <nobr>non-linear</nobr>
generation of photon pairs and photonic circuitry for light
manipulation. The chosen platform is silicon which allows to adopt (and
adapt) the worldwide standard of CMOS technology.</p>

Workflows specify a collection of tasks that must be executed under the
responsibility or supervision of human users. Workflow management
systems and <nobr>workflow-driven</nobr> applications need
to enforce security policies in the form of access control and
authorization constraints, such as Separation of Duty. Enforcing these
policies is crucial to avoid malicious use, but may lead to situations
where a workflow instance cannot be completed without the violation of
the policy. The Workflow Satisfiability Problem (WSP) asks whether
there exists an assignment of users to tasks in a workflow such that
every task is executed and the policy is not violated. The WSP is
inherently hard, but solutions to this problem have a practical
application in reconciling business compliance and business continuity.
The main contributions of this work are three: 1. We present a
technique to synthesize monitors to solve the <nobr>run-time</nobr>
version of the WSP. 2. We introduce and solve a new class of problems
related to finding execution scenarios that satisfy properties of
interest to users. 3. We implement the proposed techniques in two
tools: Cerberus for workflow management systems and Aegis for <nobr>workflow-driven</nobr>
web applications.</p>

Mathematical modeling represents a powerful tool with a wide range of
applications in epidemiology and public health. They can help
disentangling the complexity of transmission of infectious diseases and
provide explanations for the trends observed in the data (e.g.
recurrent epidemics, seasonality). More importantly, mathematical
modeling plays a crucial role in projecting the future trends of
infectious disease dynamics and in estimating the impact of possible
interventions thus, supporting health authorities in the choice of
adequate strategies for the effective prevention and control of
infectious cases. In this thesis I investigate different topics of
interest for the current computational epidemiology of infectious
diseases and public health. First, I study the role of demographic
processes in the epidemiology of varicella and Herpes Zoster and I
provide a <nobr>cost-effectiveness</nobr> evaluation of
varicella and Herpes Zoster vaccination in Italy. Second, I use a
computational model to detect and quantify the effect of spontaneous
behavioral changes on the spatiotemporal dynamics of the 2009 H1N1
influenza pandemic in England. Finally, I investigate the current
epidemiology of measles in Italy in order to shed some light on the
epidemiological features of vaccine preventable diseases in frameworks
characterized by a low circulation of the virus.</p>
