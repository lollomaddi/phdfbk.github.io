Through the ERC Starting Grants, the EU attracts young research talent
and keeps it in Europe. With the EU backing these grantees will be able
to pursue their best ideas, but also create quality jobs for more
research staff who wish to work on the frontiers of science. Ultimately
they will contribute to creating the most valuable resource Europe has:
human capital. The ERC believes in supporting young talent - indeed two
thirds of its funding goes to <nobr>early-career</nobr>
researchers contributing to the future of Europe in terms of science
and more broadly. It is pivotal to keep scientific quality as the one
and only selection criterion, and to trust researchers to choose
significant topics, without imposing any demands on what to be
explored. Giving top researchers free reign to follow their scientific
curiosity opens the way to real breakthroughs as a recent independent
study found: as much as 71% of the first completed ERC projects led to
breakthroughs or major scientific advances. This speaks volumes about
the relevance to fund <nobr>bottom-up</nobr> frontier
research – it creates new knowledge and offers new paths for economic
growth.</p>

Testing of Android Apps for Detecting Permission <nobr>Re-delegation</nobr>
Vulnerabilities</p>

<p class="p23 ft5"><span class="ft21">Abstract</span>:
Software systems are composed of multiple components. Components hold
special privileges to perform different tasks. Controlled access to
system resources is achieved through permission based security model.
In order to gain privieges, a malicious component usually has to abuse
a privileged component. This phenomenon is commonly known as the
confused deputy attack. Confused deputy attack occurs when a privileged
component performs an activity that needs special permission on behalf
of other component that does not have the required permission. Static
analysis is often used to detect existence of this vulnerability.
However, reports of static analysis are vulnerability points rather
than conditions that cause the vulnerability. Therefore, a developer
that wishes to fix this vulnerability has to manually analyze the code
in order to understand the conditions that cause the vulnerability.
Similar to other permission based systems, the Android system also
suffers from the confused deputy attack called permission <nobr>re-delegation.</nobr>
In this work, we present our approach on how to automatically generate
test case that reveal permission <nobr>re-delegation</nobr>
vulnerability in Android apps. Previous results showed that not every
reported permission <nobr>re-delegation</nobr> is a
vulnerability as <nobr>re-delegation</nobr> is a feature
of the Android framework. Therefore, we need to minimize the report to
those potential permission <nobr>re-delegation</nobr>
vulnerabilities. We propose an automated test oracle based on top
applications from the official market and compare behaviors of
vulnerable applications to similar applications in the market.</p>

Internet of Services applications need to cope with a continuously
changing environment, both in terms of the context in which they
operate, and of the services, users and providers involved. In this
setting, adaptivity is to be considered an intrinsic characteristic of
applications rather than an exception to be handled. We propose a
design for adaptation approach that fully exploits the advantages of
the service- oriented paradigm to support the development and operation
of <nobr>service-based</nobr> applications operating in
highly dynamic environments. The approach is based on dynamic and
incremental service composition and <nobr>re-configuration</nobr>
techniques and it has been evaluated on a <nobr>real-world</nobr>

<p class="p25 ft30"><span class="ft29">Abstract:
</span>Semantic Image Interpretation (SII) is the process of
automatically generating meaningful descriptions of the content of
images. An example of meaningful image description is a graph which
nodes correspond to image objects and the arcs to semantic relations
between objects. Background knowledge (BK), in the form of logical
theories, is extremely useful for SII. Many <nobr>state-of-the-art</nobr>
algorithms for SII mainly adopt a <nobr>bottom-up</nobr>
approach, which generates semantic interpretations of images starting
from their low- level features. BK is used only at a late stage for
enriching the semantic descriptions. In this work, we show how BK plays
an important role also during the early phase of SII if integrated with
<nobr>low-level</nobr> image features. To this aim, we
propose: (i) a reference framework where a semantic image
interpretation is a partial model of the BK. The elements of the
partial model are grounded (linked) to a (set of) image segment(s).
(ii) The use of Logic Tensor Network to predict an approximation of a
partial model of a picture according to the BK. Logic Tensor Network is
a framework that integrates learning from numerical data and logical
reasoning over the BK. This integration allows us to reason over the <nobr>low-level</nobr>
features of objects in a picture and to express facts between them
consistently with the constraints of the BK. We evaluate our method on
the task of classifying objects and their parts in the images of the <nobr>PASCAL-Part</nobr>
dataset. In this experiment we combine the features extracted with a <nobr>state-of-the-art</nobr>
object detector with BK expressed as a <nobr>part-whole</nobr>
ontology. Our approach outperforms the <nobr>state-of-the-art</nobr>
on object classification, and improves the performances on <nobr>part-whole</nobr>
relation detection with respect to a <nobr>rule-based</nobr>
baseline.</p>

<nobr>State-of-the-art</nobr> neural machine translation
(NMT) systems are generally very sensitive to the training domain and
their performance degrades if the test set belongs to a different
domain than the training data. Therefore, the current NMT systems are
trained on specific domains by carefully selecting the training sets
and applying proper domain adaptation techniques. However, in <nobr>real-world</nobr>
applications it is very hard, if not impossible, to develop and
maintain several specific MT systems for multiple domains. This is
mostly due to the fact that usually: i) the target domain is not known
in advance, and users might query different sentences from different
domains; ii) the application domains are very diverse, making it not
feasible to develop and <nobr>fine-tune</nobr> one system
for each domain, which makes the possibility of developing and <nobr>fine-tuning</nobr>
one system for each domain unfeasible; iii) there is no (or very
limited amount of) indomain training data to train <nobr>domain-specific</nobr>
MT engines. In this situation, it is necessary to have high quality MT
systems that perform consistently well in all (or most of) the domains.
In this project we propose effective solutions for developing <nobr>multi-domain</nobr>
NMT systems that their performance does not degrade by changing the
application domain and perform equally well in all the domains.</p>

Detecting contrast, both among words and among portions of text, is a
fundamental requirement for text analysis, thus playing a crucial role
in applications such as machine translation, discourse understanding,
and information retrieval. My research is focused on the study of
opposition relations between verbs and contrast relations at textual
level. Through a <nobr>crowd-sourcing</nobr> experiment, I
bring evidences that i) opposition relations exist between senses of
verbs, and ii) there exist different types of opposition relations with
different characteristics. Moreover, I focused on contrast relations at
textual level that can be either marked by textual connectives or
implicitly conveyed. In particular, I aim at creating an exhaustive
list of the textual connectives for contrast relations in Italian, and
by analysing corpora I am studying which are other linguistic
strategies used to communicate contrast in texts and if these
strategies have any regularities (for example, what is the relation
between lexical opposition and contrast marked by an explicit
connective at textual level?). I mainly investigate these relations in
the Italian language, using and developing lexical resources such as
the <nobr>T-PAS</nobr> resource [1] and the LICO resource
[2].</p>

In the last years, the research in the gas sensor field experienced a
significant boost. Gas sensors represent the crucial elements in gas
monitoring systems and olfactory systems for several applications:
environmental monitoring, safety and security, quality control of food
production, medical diagnosis and so on. The principal parts that
compose a chemoresistive gas sensor, the microheater and the sensing
material, are under continuous evolution, in order to improve the whole
performance of the device. From the point of view of the gas sensing
design, the substrate plays a fundamental role, because acts as a
heater, mechanical support and transducer of the sensor response. The
application of MEMS technology for the fabrication of silicon device
with low power consumption has offered new opportunities for innovative
gas sensor design. At the same time, the development of new sensing
materials is strongly demanded, in order to exceed the problems showed
by the materials proposed until now, such as lack of stability and
selectivity.</p>
<p class="p23 ft28">In this work, we studied different
approaches in order to realize suitable silicon microheaters for
chemoresistive gas sensors and new sensing materials, available for
high operating temperatures (650 °C) through the MEMS technology.</p>

Mimicking nature to achieve special properties is a brunch of science
that has become popular in the last few decades. Of particular interest
for their properties are lotus leaf and sharkskin. Lotus leaf has a
superhydrophobic surface and sharkskin has drag reduction properties.
Specifically the <nobr>self-cleaning</nobr> effect is
wildly known as the ‘lotus effect’. <nobr>Bio-inspired</nobr>
surfaces of lotus leaf have low adhesion, water repellency and <nobr>self-cleaning</nobr>
<nobr>[1-3].</nobr> These properties arise from a
combination of chemical and <nobr>micro-structuration</nobr>
of the surface. Combining roughness and a hydrophobic surface leads to
superhydrophobicity, while using a hydrophilic substrate generally
leads to superhydrophilicity. Sharkskin is known to have a low drag
coefficient that lead at increment of swimming speed and lower power
consumption. The second part of my work consist on combining lotus leaf
and sharkskin effects. For this purpose a systematic range of
hierarchical and <nobr>non-hierarchical</nobr> structures
have been analysed, in order to find a clear relationship between
wettability and flow properties. Static and dynamic contact angle, tilt
angle and pressure drop, measured long a channel, are the value used
for this analysis. Part of my work consist in generate and analyze <nobr>silicon-based</nobr>
<nobr>micro-,</nobr> nano- and hierarchical patterns [4].
Also PDMS patterns are generate starting from a silicon mold.
Wettability analysis are based on the measure of contact angle, tilting
angle and advancing &amp; receding angles.</p>

Large scale emergency events may have dramatic political, economical
and social consequences. These events may result in higher crime rates,
spreading of infectious diseases, economic crises, and migration
phenomena (e.g. refugees across borders or internally displaced
people). Hence, early detection of emergency events, such as riots and
natural disasters, is of paramount relevance. Based on the assumption
that emergency events influence people communication and mobility
patterns, we propose to use Call Detail Records (CDR), collected by
mobile telecommunication operators for billing reasons, to detect such
events. To this end, first we apply the Markov modulated Poisson
process to detect anomalies for hourly intervals. Second, we will
examine how the effects of these events propagate among different
geographical areas. The preliminary results show that our approach can
successfully detected anomalous events (e.g. confrontations between
groups) at country scale. By introducing proximity graphs, which are
constructed from mobility patterns of users, we expect to be able to
reveal the existence of specific patterns for different types of events.</p>

The knowledge about the species of trees is essential for precision
forest management practices. Modern high density airborne Light
Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) systems have the ability to acquire large
number of LiDAR points, allowing a very detailed characterization of
the forest at the individual tree level. In</p>
<p class="p23 ft28">this context, it is possible to use
such LiDAR data for accurate classification of the tree species. In
this paper, we consider the specific problem of species classification
of trees belonging to the conifer class. However, species
classification within a class (e.g., the conifer class) using LiDAR
data is a challenging problem when considering the tree external crown
characteristics only. The Internal Crown Geometric Features (IGFs) are
defined based on a novel internal branch structure model that uses 3D
region growing and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to delineate the
branch structure of a conifer tree accurately. Internal crown geometric
features are used together with external crown geometric features
(EGFs) to with the objective of performing an efficient conifer species
classification. Support Vector Machines (SVM) was used for
classification and to evaluate the accuracy.</p>

The oracle problem remains one of the key challenges in software

The effectiveness of a test case in revealing software faults depends
critically on the quality of the oracle. The poster presents a
technique for assessing and improving test oracles by reducing the
incidence of both false positives and false negatives. We use test case
generation to reveal false positives and mutation testing to reveal
false negatives. The experimental results show that the fault detection

Neuroscientific experiments investigate the subject’s response to
external stimulation. Stimulation categories and the order they appear
to the subject are defined in the stimulation protocol. In traditional
experiments, when the data is analyzed in the offline mode, protocol is
fixed beforehand and does not change in the course of experimental data
acquisition. In <nobr>real-time</nobr> neuroscientific
experiments the data is analyzed in the online mode simultaneously with
the acquisition process. <nobr>Real-time</nobr>
experiments allow to examine a broader range of scientific questions,
for instance, how to bring the subject in a certain state or how the
outcome of the cognitive task depends on the subject’s state. There is
growing interest in experiments of this type, because the community
along with the traditional group studies is more and more turining to
modelling individuals for the purpose of customized interventions. A
key advantage of <nobr>real-time</nobr> experimentation is
the possibility to adjust the experiment protocol as you go, basing on
the subject’s response. This, in turn, requires having adequate models
of the subject’s state dynamics and efficient algorithms for the
optimal choice of the stimulation/feedback being delivered to the
subject. There is a plethora of methods for the protocol adjustment,
but still important gaps exist especially when there is need for
adaptation in view of a particular experimental goal. We will show how
the problem of <nobr>real-time</nobr> protocol adaptation
can be tackled in the context of a <nobr>real-time</nobr>
Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) experiment and in a <nobr>real-time</nobr>

Gamification uses game elements and game mechanics in a <nobr>non-game</nobr>
context in order to reach a certain goal (e.g., incentivizing people to
change their behaviors in a specific domain). While gamification is
often effective in inducing such behavioural changes, <nobr>well-known</nobr>
limitations concern retaining the interest of players over the long
term, and sustaining the new behaviors promoted through the game.
Hence, there is a need to devise techniques to keep users interested
and engaged to participate in the gamified system in the long term. We
propose an approach based on the Procedural Content Generation of
personalized and contextualized playable units that appeal to each
player, and make her user experience more varied and individually
compelling. To this end, we have built a <nobr>context-aware</nobr>
recommender system (CARS) to generate and recommend personalized
challenges, based on the player’s preference, history, game status and
performance. Hereby we describe our approach, and evaluate it using a
smart urban mobility game that involved the proposal of weekly

Internet traffic is generated by a multitude of different applications,
everyone characterized by its own connectivity requirements. However,
networks usually provision all the traffic in the same shortest paths
between a source and a destination, thus ignoring the specific
requirements of every application. In order to overcome this issue, the
<nobr><span class="ft40">application-centric</span></nobr><span class="ft40"> networking </span>offers a new approach
to construct transport networks. The application requirements are taken
into account in the whole provisioning process, from the highest level
(e.g., IP) to the lowest one (e.g., optical). The communication of
connectivity requirements from applications to networks needs to be
performed by means of interfaces that abstract the specific commands
and the low level details of the network implementation. In this
context, the <nobr>Intent-driven</nobr> networking aims at
simplifying the configuration of programmable networks by shifting the
attention from <nobr>low-level</nobr> network
configurations to <nobr>high-level</nobr> goals. By
exploiting this paradigm, the applications need only to concentrate on <span class="ft40">what </span>they want rather than <span class="ft40">how </span>the network performs their
request. We propose an <nobr>Intent-based</nobr> protocol
for <span class="ft40">requesting </span>and <span class="ft40">negotiating </span>a connectivity
service with specific requirements between applications and networks.
The applications can request a connectivity service and, in case of the
amount of network resources cannot satisfy the original request, the
network offers several alternative solutions for a reduced service to
the application. Moreover, the acceptance or the rejection of one of
the proposed alternative solutions is performed automatically by the
application.</p>

In my PhD research, I explore the expressive abilities of haptic
communication, considering the case study of rock climbing. In recent
years, research in <nobr>Human-Computer</nobr> Interaction
has shown increasing interest in the design and development of
interfaces that do not rely only on visual displays and vision as
sensory modality to interact. In this respect, haptic feedback has
gained increasing interest as means to convey information, since it can
be perceived by our body through the sense of touch. So far, haptic
feedback has been investigated for the acquisition of motor skills (for
example in the domains of surgery, instrument playing, and sport) and
for emotional communication, trying the reproduce the expressiveness of
touch typical of <nobr>co-located</nobr> interpersonal
communication (such as intimacy, closeness, reassurance, etc.), also in
remote communication. Being linked to the sense of touch in order to be
perceived and understood, the systems that exploit haptic feedback need
to be in direct contact with the body; thus, they are mainly divided in
tangible and wearable devices. In my research, I explore the
communicative abilities of haptic feedback in the context of rock
climbing, an extreme sport that requires both the skillful use of the
body and the control over negative emotions. By considering the
opportunities and constraints offered by technology, and the users’
needs, values, and motivations, I aim at designing a valuable and
usable device for the community of climbers and, at the same time, at
investigating the communicative abilities of haptic feedback. As a
general framework for my thesis, I adopt a <nobr>co-evolutionary</nobr>
design approach (Agostini et al. 2000) which divided the design process
in three main aspects, namely user research, technology exploration,
and concepts generation. According to this framework, the investigation
of the three aspects is performed in parallel and alternate moments of
divergence, when the investigation goes deep into the details of each
of them, to moments of converge, when each aspect informs the others.
So far, I have conducted an extensive field study with beginner
climbers aimed at identifying a possible design space for haptic
communication in climbing. Results have shown that during the learning
phase the probability of experiencing negative emotions is higher, due
to the lack of skills and of familiarity with the new sensations that
the vertical dimension of this sport provides. Currently, instructors
address negative emotions by giving suggestions or reassuring the
climber. However, often there are contextual problems that hinder the
communication between who climbs and who is on the ground, such as
distance and noise. These instances suggest a space of design for
alternative ways of communication between the actors involved, and it
is within this space of design that I explore the opportunities offered
by haptic communication in terms of expressivity, usefulness and
acceptability. Regarding the design, I conducted two workshops aimed at
exploring form factor, body location, purpose, and kind of vibration of
a possible haptic wearable device. From the technological perspective,
the exploration conducted has led to choose vibration as form of haptic
communication and to the development of an early wearable prototype
that can be activated through Bluetooth. As final steps of</p>
<p class="p23 ft28">my research, I plan to conduct a study
on the understandability of different vibrations in order to define a
vocabulary of instructions useful in the climbing context and to
conduct an evaluation of the wearable vibrotactile prototype in
ecological setting (i.e. in a climbing course in an indoor gym).</p>

The automated comparison of points of view between two politicians is a
very challenging task, due not only to the lack of annotated resources,
but also to the different dimensions participating to the definition of
agreement and disagreement. In order to shed light on this complex
task, we first carry out a study, on transcriptions of political
speeches, to manually annotate the components involved in detecting
agreement and disagreement. Then, based on the features and
interactions observed in this study, we propose an approach to capture,
via supervised classification, divergences and similarities in points
of view between different authors or speakers when they deal with the
same topic. We do not focus on debates in dialogical form, but we
rather consider sets of documents in which politicians may express
their position with respect to different topics, both in an implicit or
explicit way, like during an electoral campaign.</p>

Social Media have become a valuable source of <nobr>up-to-date</nobr>
knowledge about any fictional and real- life entity including persons,
organisations, events and many others. Recently, researchers have
started to use this knowledge to solve or improve on a number of tasks
across different fields including Natural Language Processing and Image
Processing. Many new research directions have emerged as well. In my
research, I propose a concept of Social Annotation that is defined as a
task of linking named entities in a given text to their corresponding
Social Media entities, like, for example, hashtags, user profiles and
pages. This task is very similar to Named Entity Linking, where the
Social Network is used instead of the Knowledge Base. Social Annotation
can, therefore, provide a rich <nobr>up-to-date</nobr>
context to the input text, making the result much more appealing and
complete for further processing and usage. However, dealing with Social
Media imposes a number of new challenges including noisiness and scale
of data that need to be processed. I aim to overcome such challenges in
my research.</p>

Nanoporous materials are very interesting for their performance in gas
absorption and gas separation. In recent years, various novel materials
were proposed to surpass traditional ones such as silicon carbide,
polymers, <nobr>metal-organic</nobr> framework (MOF).
Among these, many are <nobr>graphene-based</nobr>
materials, which presents high <nobr>surface-to-volume</nobr>
ratio, good mechanical properties and considerable chemical stability. <nobr>Graphene-based</nobr>
nanostructures – such as graphene frameworks, <nobr>graphene-oxide</nobr>
frameworks (GOF), or functionalized graphene foams – can be used for
gas adsorption, separation, and purification. The microstructures and
chemistry of these novel materials can be tailored to obtain a
favourable trade off between gas permeability and selectivity. In this
contribution, we present results of Molecular Dynamics and Grand
Canonical Monte Carlo computer simulation methods modeling the
properties of the most promising of these <nobr>graphene-based</nobr>

Ontologies are used in computer science to represent knowledge in a
formal and unambiguous way, facilitating knowledge reuse and sharing
among people and computer systems. Manually encoding the knowledge
carried by unstructured sources (e.g., documents, <nobr>web-pages,</nobr>
and so on) into a formal representation can be costly and <nobr>time-consuming.</nobr>
Indeed, the knowledge acquisition bottleneck is one of the main
obstacles to a wide adoption of semantic web and knowledge management
technology. To overcome this problem, several methods and tools have
been proposed to automatically extract (that is, learn) ontologies from
unstructured sources, thus supporting knowledge engineers in this task.
These methods still suffer from severe limitations: either they are
limited in the expressiveness of the automatically acquired knowledge
or, when targeting the extraction of expressive knowledge, they rely on
sets of hand- crafted patterns that are expensive to maintain and
evolve. Our goal is to overcome these limitations by designing and
training a single Deep Learning based system capable to support the
automatic extraction of expressive knowledge in a completely automatic,
<nobr>end-to-end</nobr> fashion. Results so far have shown
that our approach can effectively contribute to the automatic ontology
learning problem.</p>

Deep learning technologies have recently revolutionized many research
fields , including vision, machine translation, natural language
processing, bioinformatics, taking a fundamental leap towards
artificial intelligence. This technology is also playing a remarkable
role in progressively building machines that understand speech,
resulting in several popular applications ranging from <nobr>web-search</nobr>
to car control and intelligent personal assistants. Unfortunately, most
<nobr>state-of-the-art</nobr> systems provide a
satisfactory performance only in <nobr>close-talking</nobr>
scenarios, where the user is forced to speak very close to a
microphone- equipped device. Considering the growing interest towards
speech recognition and the progressive use of this technology in
everyday lives, it is easy to predict that in the future users will
prefer to relax the constraint of handling or wearing any device to
access speech recognition services, requiring technologies able to
better cope with <nobr>distant-talking</nobr> interactions
also in challenging acoustic environments. A prominent limitation of
current systems lies in the lack of matching and communication between
the various technologies involved in the distant speech recognition
process. The main modules are indeed typically trained independently
and arranged in a pipeline based on a unidirectional communication
between the components. To address such a concern, we propose to
replace this pipeline with an architecture based on a novel network of
deep neural networks paradigm, where all the modules are jointly
trained and better cooperate with each other thanks to a full
communication scheme between them. Experiments, conducted using
different datasets, tasks and acoustic conditions, revealed that the
proposed framework can significantly overtake other competitive <nobr>state-of-the-art</nobr>
solutions.</p>

Digital identity (DI) management is a key factor to enable the adoption
of innovative digital and physical services. Requirements for a
complete DI solution include legal, security and technological aspects.
For example, the national laws (e.g., SPID) and European regulations
(e.g., eIDAS) prohibit to use social login solutions to access <nobr>e-health</nobr>
services. The process of defining DI management systems is only at an
early stage and solutions capable of addressing all these aspects are
missing. In this context, our goal is to propose novel authentication
and authorization solutions that satisfy the expected security
requirements and protect user privacy, while complying with national
and European laws and directives. In particular, we have focused on
mobile technologies. Indeed, while for web applications there exist
many secure authentication and authorization solutions to protect the
user's DI and online resources, solutions for the mobile context are
not well consolidated. This is a huge limitation as mobile applications
are dominating the market of online services, with a total of 4.9
billion unique mobile subscribers by the end of 2016 (more than 60% of
the world population). Our DI solutions are designed and developed in
three different contexts: (1) smart city: we have proposed an <nobr>OAuth-based</nobr>
solution for secure delegated access to online resources. An
implementation of this solution has been integrated in the Smart
Community Platform of FBK for developing open services in</p>
<p class="p25 ft30">the Trentino region and is being used
daily by up to 13,000 users. (2) <nobr>e-health:</nobr> an
implementation of our proposed Single <nobr>Sign-On</nobr>
model is currently tested by the users of TreC (acronym for Cartella
Clinica del Cittadino), a personal health record system. TreC is
currently deploying a number of Android applications to support <nobr>self-management</nobr>
and remote monitoring of chronic conditions. The solution we propose
will allow patients to access different TreC <nobr>e-health</nobr>
mobile applications with a SSO experience. (3) single digital market:
we are involved in a EIT Digital project called FIDES (acronym for
Federated Identity Management System). Its goal is to manage digital
identities in a federated way, creating an identity ecosystem that
permits the access to digital and physical services in a secure, <nobr>cross-border</nobr>
and <nobr>multi-device</nobr> way.</p>

<nobr>Light-Harvesting</nobr> (LH) <nobr>Pigment-Protein</nobr>
Complexes in plants and photosynthetic bacteria, constitute the
fundamental units through which sunlight is collected. The harvested
energy is then redirected towards a Reaction Center by means of
extremely efficient Energy Transfer (ET) processes, where its
conversion to chemical energy, for the organisms’ <nobr>self-sustenance,</nobr>
finally occurs. The high complexity of such systems, where multiple
interacting chromophores are embedded in a fluctuating protein matrix,
makes it extremely difficult to study their response to external
excitations, both theoretically and experimentally. In this respect,
advances in <nobr>non-linear</nobr> electronic
spectroscopy with femtosecond time resolution, such as the Two-
Dimensional Electronic Spectroscopy (2DES), have provided new insight
on energy transfer processes [1], allowing to decongest the overlapping
transient spectra. High density of information is obtained, but to
accurately disentangle all these features and reach a detailed and
reliable map of the ET routes is still a challenge. A solution is to
integrate the measurements with theoretical models that become
mandatory for experiments interpretation [2].</p>
<p class="p26 ft37">Here we introduce a fully <nobr>Quantum-Chemistry</nobr>
based protocol to simulate 2DES spectra of complex multi- chromophoric
architectures of known structure. The proposed scheme relies on a QM/MM
<nobr>multi-scale</nobr> approach [3,4] able to link single
chromophoric units with the whole molecular aggregate via a so called
Frenkel Exciton Hamiltonian, eventually delivering the system’s
manifold of states with an unprecedented accuracy. The level of
sophistication obtained, also including molecular vibrations and
environmental fluctuations, allows us to simulate and interpret linear
and <nobr>non-linear</nobr> spectroscopy, providing a
deeper insight of the recorded spectral signatures. Application to the
LH2 test case, employed here as a challenging playground, shows a
remarkable agreement with the experiments and sheds new light on some
still debated features of this extensively studied antenna system.</p>

The use of remote sensing in the analysis and evaluation of
environmental changes has become a valuable tool which relevance has
increased with the improvement in acquisition sensor technology as well
as in the data/image processing algorithms. The capability to
understand and detect those changes increases when we consider Very
High spatial Resolution (VHR) multispectral images acquired by passive
sensors such as IKONOS, QuickBird, GeoEye, <nobr>WorldView-2</nobr>
and Pleiades. Nevertheless, the revisit period of each single sensor,
their competing orders, and the weather conditions do not always allow
the acquisition of proper and continuous information. To mitigate these
limitations, it is possible to build time series by considering images
acquired by different sensors. The challenge becomes how to deal with
this kind of information. Therefore, the aims of this proposal are
mainly two: i) <nobr>multi-sensor</nobr> multitemporal VHR
data homogenization; and ii) change detection for the analysis of VHR <nobr>multi-sensor</nobr>
multitemporal images.</p>

Information Extraction, that is the task aimed at automatically

active area of research in the Natural Language Processing (NLP)
community. However resources and automatic systems developed so far
have mainly addressed contemporary texts. Finding new approaches to the
automatic identification of information also in historical documents
can, indeed, assist historians in enhancing their work while dealing
with the ever increasing amount of digital sources and, moreover, it
can have an impact both on NLP and on Digital Humanities research. In
this poster we present a new Information Extraction task applied to
historical documents: more specifically we present a new corpus of
historical travel guides, a new scheme for the annotation of Content
Types (i.e., text passages with specific semantic and functional
characteristics) and the results of two preliminary sets of
classification experiments. The identification of Content Types may
improve the performance of more complex NLP tasks, for example timeline
building, by targeting the portions of the documents that are more
relevant.</p>

Language is the main communication device to represent the environment
and share a common understanding of the world that we perceive through
of our sensory organs. Therefore, each language might contain a great
amount of sensorial elements to express the perceptions both in literal
and figurative usage. In contrast to being an anomaly, figurative
language, especially metaphors within the scope of this study, is
pervasive in the common language and should be handled by any NLP
application that includes a semantic task. In order to tackle the
semantics of figurative language, several conceptual properties are
utilized, such as concreteness or imegeability. However, to the best of
our knowledge, there is no attempt in the literature to analyze and
benefit from the sensorial elements for the figurative language
processing. In this research, we propose to exploit sensorial affinity
of the words as a feature for metaphor identification task.
Additionally, we introduce the automatic detection of synaesthetic
metaphors, which is one of the most common metaphoric transfers.</p>

Acoustic signal processing is the automatic manipulation of acoustic
signals, aiming at the recording, storage and generation of acoustic
signals, and the extraction and encoding of related information. There
is a wide range of target applications, such as audio analysis and
synthesis, speech enhancement, audio source separation and signal
processing for loudspeakers and microphone arrays. In the core of such
systems, the application of the <nobr>short-time</nobr>
Fourier transform (STFT) results in a representation of the temporal
evolution of the frequency components of the acoustic signal, commonly
known as the spectrogram. Although the spectrogram is extensively used,
it suffers from certain limitations, as for instance the unavoidable <nobr>trade-off</nobr>
between the time and frequency resolution. In this thesis we study the
use of an improved representation, obtained with the method of <nobr>time-frequency</nobr>
reassignment. According to this method, the traditional spectrogram, as
obtained from the STFT, is reassigned to a sharper version called the
reassigned spectrogram. In this thesis, we elaborate on approaches that
utilize the reassigned spectrogram, and exploit this representation in
the context of different applications. Original solutions are presented
in two application domains, namely distant speech recognition and
melody extraction from polyphonic music signals.</p>

The study of causality has drawn the attention of researches for
centuries from many different fields. In particular, nowadays causal
inference is a central question in neuroscience and an entire body of
research called brain effective connectivity, is devoted to detect
causal interactions between distinct brain areas. Brain effective
connectivity is typically studied through the analysis of direct
measurements of the neural activity, e.g. <nobr>magneto-electroencephalography</nobr>
<nobr>(M-EEG)</nobr> signals, functional MRI (fMRI)
signals, single cell recordings etc. The main purpose of my PhD
activity is on methods for doing time series causality. More in
details, we focus on a <nobr>well-establish</nobr>
criterion of causality: the Granger criterion, which is based on the
concepts of temporal precedence and predictability. The activity that
we present is about a new approach to the problem of time series
causality that is based on machine learning and, specifically, on
learning from examples. Given a set of signals, their causal
interactions are estimated by a classifier that was trained on a
synthetic dataset generated in order to be representative of the actual
context. This approach that we call supervised parametric approach, was
implemented by adopting the Granger criterion of causality and compared
with the standard parametric measure of causality derived from the same
criterion. Moreover, the roles of the feature space and the generative
model of the training set are investigated through a simulation study.
And an example of real application is shown with rat neural recordings.</p>

Workflows specify a collection of tasks that must be executed under the
responsibility or supervision of human users. Workflow management
systems and <nobr>workflow-driven</nobr> applications need
to enforce security policies in the form of access control and
authorization constraints, such as Separation of Duty. Enforcing these
policies is crucial to avoid malicious use, but may lead to situations
where a workflow instance cannot be completed without the violation of
the policy. The Workflow Satisfiability Problem (WSP) asks whether
there exists an assignment of users to tasks in a workflow such that
every task is executed and the policy is not violated. The WSP is
inherently hard, but solutions to this problem have a practical
application in reconciling business compliance and business continuity.
The main contributions of this work are three: 1. We present a
technique to synthesize monitors to solve the <nobr>run-time</nobr>
version of the WSP. 2. We introduce and solve a new class of problems
related to finding execution scenarios that satisfy properties of
interest to users. 3. We implement the proposed techniques in two
tools: Cerberus for workflow management systems and Aegis for <nobr>workflow-driven</nobr>
web applications.</p>

From industrial revolution to the present day, fossil fuels are the

fuels on environment urge energy planners to integrate renewable
energies into the corresponding energy systems. However, <nobr>large-scale</nobr>
incorporation of renewable energies into the systems is difficult
because of intermittent behaviors, limited availability and economic
barriers. It requires intricate balancing among different energy
producing resources and the syringes among all the major energy
sectors. Although it is possible to evaluate a given energy scenario
(complete set of parameters describing a system) by using a simulation
model, however, identifying optimal energy scenarios with respect to
multiple objectives is a very difficult to accomplished. In addition,
no generalized optimization framework is available that can handle all
major sectors of an energy system. In this regards, we propose a
complete generalized framework for identifying scenarios with respect
to multiple objectives. The framework is developed by coupling a <nobr>multi-objective</nobr>
evolutionary algorithm and EnergyPLAN. The results show that the tool
has the capability to handle multiple energy sectors together,
moreover, a number of optimized <nobr>trade-off</nobr>

Mathematical modeling represents a powerful tool with a wide range of
applications in epidemiology and public health. They can help
disentangling the complexity of transmission of infectious diseases and
provide explanations for the trends observed in the data (e.g.
recurrent epidemics, seasonality). More importantly, mathematical
modeling plays a crucial role in projecting the future trends of
infectious disease dynamics and in estimating the impact of possible
interventions thus, supporting health authorities in the choice of
adequate strategies for the effective prevention and control of

varicella and Herpes Zoster vaccination in Italy. Second, I use a
computational model to detect and quantify the effect of spontaneous
behavioral changes on the spatiotemporal dynamics of the 2009 H1N1
influenza pandemic in England. Finally, I investigate the current
epidemiology of measles in Italy in order to shed some light on the
epidemiological features of vaccine preventable diseases in frameworks
characterized by a low circulation of the virus.</p>

<nobr>Memristor-Based</nobr> Computing Architecture with
Advanced Signal Processing Capabilities is aimed at developing advanced
processing architectures, exploiting the main characteristics of the
memristor, which combines resistive and memory properties. Memristors
have been considered as the fourth fundamental passive element joining
the resistor, capacitor and the inductor ̶predicted in the early 70s by
Chua and first physically demonstrated in 2008 at the Hewlett Packard
laboratories. This work sought to exploit the properties of the
memristor particularly its application in analogue integrated circuits.
Firstly, an electrical model of the memristor was implemented to enable
CAD simulation and then several <nobr>memristor-based</nobr>
analogue ICs applications were investigated. Novel electronic circuits
have been investigated, exploiting memristor characteristics, to be the
basic building blocks for the realisation of prototypes of a complex <nobr>memristor-based</nobr>
adaptive network. Some of the novel circuits implemented during this
work are - Architectures for interfacing memristive systems with
photodetector <nobr>front-end;</nobr> Adaptive Background
Subtraction for <nobr>memristor-based</nobr> image
processing algorithms; Memristors and their applications to adaptive
vision systems; <nobr>multi-layer</nobr> neural network
interfaced with memristive devices.</p>

Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) data allows the
reconstruction of the neural pathways of the white matter of the brain
as a set of 3D polylines, by means of tractography algorithms. The</p>
<p class="p25 ft23">3D polylines are called streamlines
and the set of whole streamlines is called tractogram, which represents
the structural connectome of the brain. In neurological studies, it is
often important to identify the group of streamlines belonging to the
same anatomical structure, called tract or bundle, like the <nobr>cortico-spinal</nobr>
tract or the arcuate fasciculus. The statistical analysis of the
diffusion data of tracts is used in multiple applications, for example,
to study gender differences , to observe the changes in age and to
correlate it with diseases. The extraction of tracts of interest is
called the tract segmentation problem. Due to the anatomical
variability across subjects, tract segmentation problem are difficult
to solve. In this thesis, we propose a novel supervised tract
segmentation method, that segments the tract of interest in a new
subject using a set of segmented tracts as prior information. Our
proposed supervised segmentation approach is based on the concept of
the streamline correspondence i.e. to find which streamline in one
tractogram correspond to which streamline in the other tractogram. We
showed that streamline correspondence can be a powerful principle to
transfer the anatomical information of a given bundle from one subject
to another one. In the current literature of supervised segmentation,
streamline correspondence has been addressed with a nearest neighbour
strategy. We observed that finding corresponding streamlines with the
nearest neighbour strategy is suboptimal. In the contrary, in this
thesis we address the tract segmentation problem as a rectangular
linear assignment problem (RLAP), a cornerstone of combinatorial
optimization. By investigating the existing optimal solution of the
rectangular linear assignment, we adopted the efficient solution for
the streamline correspondence problem.</p>

This talk is about Blast, a <nobr>BLAck-box</nobr>
Security Testing tool for discovering security vulnerabilities in the
protocols underling <nobr>security-critical</nobr> <nobr>Multi-Party</nobr>
Web Applications (MPWAs). MPWAs rely on core trusted <nobr>third-party</nobr>
<nobr>systems–e.g.,</nobr> payment servers, identity <nobr>providers–and</nobr>
<nobr>protocols–e.g.,</nobr> <nobr>Cashier-as-a-Service,</nobr>
Single <nobr>Sign-On–to</nobr> deliver business services
to users. Blast leverages 6 attack patterns (generalizations of 11
prominent attacks from the literature) to generate attack test cases
against the MPWAs under test. Blast has been used to discover 21 <nobr>previously-unknown</nobr>
security vulnerabilities in prominent MPWAs (e.g. twitter.com, OpenCart
v2.1.0.1). The implementation of Blast is based on OWASP ZAP, a <nobr>widely-used,</nobr>
<nobr>open-source</nobr> penetration testing tool. Blast is
currently being experimented at SAP and other industrial players are
considering its adoption.</p>

The depositions of various <nobr>nano-materials</nobr>
onto graphene nanoplatelets (layers of graphene) are ideal for
different applications. Deposition by radio frequency (RF) sputtering
technique can degrade layers of graphene due to interaction of high
energy sputtered particles and plasma species. By optimizing the
deposition parameters, the level of damage to graphene layers can be
controlled. In this scenario, niobium pentaoxide (Nb<span class="ft42">2</span>O<span class="ft42">5</span>)
thin films deposited on graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) powder by varying
RF power and process pressures with powder vibration frequency in argon
atmosphere. The structural properties of the samples were investigated
by <nobr>X-ray</nobr> diffraction (XRD), Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) and Raman spectroscopy. For the chemical
analysis of the samples <nobr>X-ray</nobr> photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) was used. The interlayer d spacing of the GNPs
calculated from the XRD pattern changes with Nb<span class="ft42">2</span>O<span class="ft42">5 </span>decoration. By increasing Nb<span class="ft42">2</span>O<span class="ft42">5
</span>contents through RF powers and process pressures variation
defects on the surface of GNPs increased and basal planes of GNPs
gradually loss their initial ordering, decreasing the degree of
graphitization. TEM images demonstrated that GNPs decorated with around
5 to10 nm uniform layer of Nb<span class="ft42">2</span>O<span class="ft42">5 </span>on their surface were
successfully fabricated. The frequencies of the GNPs G and 2D modes
were found to undergo red shifts with decoration of Nb<span class="ft42">2</span>O<span class="ft42">5.
</span>We explained the red shift of GNPs from the Raman
frequencies in terms of tensile strain and doping induced by Nb<span class="ft42">2</span>O<span class="ft42">5</span>.
The XPS data showed that the deposition of Nb<span class="ft42">2</span>O<span class="ft42">5 </span>on GNPs, the Fermi level of
GNPs shifts downward gradually with increasing Nb<span class="ft42">2</span>O<span class="ft42">5 </span>contents due to a <nobr>p-type</nobr>
doping effect.</p>
