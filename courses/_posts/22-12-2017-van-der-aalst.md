title: Introduction to Process MIning
abstract: Process mining provides a new means to improve processes in a variety of application domains. There are two main drivers for this new technology. On the one hand, more and more events are being recorded thus providing detailed information about the history of processes. On the other hand, in most organizations there is a need to improve process performance (e.g., reduce costs and flow time) and compliance (e.g., avoid deviations or risks). This introductory course on process mining teaches students the theoretical foundations of process mining and exposes students to real-life data sets to understand challenges related to process discovery, conformance checking, and model extension.
