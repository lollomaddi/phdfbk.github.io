title: Microservices, containers, and DevOps-oriented solutions
abstract: Microservices, as emerging architectural style, and containers, as deployment means, are changing the way we develop, maintain and operate software systems. The increasing need for flexibility, reliability, and scalability is pushing for the creation of software systems as compositions of autonomous entities, which can then be evolved, maintained, and deployed independently.  While the microservices architectural style provides the basic concepts for conceiving this kind of systems, containers "evolve" the idea of virtual machine and become suitable and easy means to deploy and manage microservices easily and independently. The course will start introducing service-oriented computing to contextualize and the idea of microservice. It will then discuss the key characteristics of this (new) architectural style and it will survey the main technologies that support it. After focusing on microservices, the course will move to presenting containers, which are seen as the "standard" means to deploy and manage microservices. It will touch available technologies and it will also discuss the different options for automating the whole deployment and management process, leading to DevOps-oriented solutions. The last part of the course will be devoted to presenting some open issues and opportunities for future research in the area.
