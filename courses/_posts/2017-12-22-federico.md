title: Machine Translation
abstract: The course introduces the foundations and recent advancements of machine translation (MT), probably the most prolific application sector in computational linguistics. Machine translation deals with the automatic translation of speech or text between two languages. This technology is considered strategic for the integration of Europe as well as for the global market. Most internet companies (Google, Microsoft, Facebook, eBay, Amazon, Airbnb, ...) have their own MT research teams in order to support their geographic expansion. This course focuses on the statistical or machine learning approach which, after a long hegemony of phrase-based models, recently moved to neural network based models. While focusing on all relevant aspects related to phrase-based and neural MT, in particular modelling, training, decoding, we will also look at use cases of MT in the translation industry, ranging from e-commerce to the support of professional translators.
