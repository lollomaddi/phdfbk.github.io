title: Answer Set Programming
abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a declarative problem solving paradigm,
rooted in Logic Programming and Nonmonotonic Reasoning, which has
been gaining increasing attention during the last years. This course is a gentle
introduction to the subject; it starts with motivation and follows the historical
development of the challenge of defining a semantics for logic programs with
negation. It looks into positive programs over stratified programs to arbitrary
programs, and then proceeds to extensions with two kinds of negation (named
weak and strong negation), and disjunction in rule heads. The second part then
considers the ASP paradigm itself, and describes the basic idea. It shows some
programming techniques and briefly overviews Answer Set solvers. The third part
is devoted to ASP in the context of the SemanticWeb, presenting some formalisms
and mentioning some applications in this area. The course concludes with issues
of current and future ASP research.
