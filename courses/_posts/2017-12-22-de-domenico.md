title: Multilayer Networks
abstract: This course is thought as a first introduction to the framework of multilayer networks, i.e. graphs whose nodes are connected by links of different nature. The course will start with a detailed introduction of the multilayer framework, both from the theoretical and the applicative points of view, using the tensorial approach. In particular, it will be shown how to transfer all key concepts of graph theory into the multilayer networks, approaching some also some very recent results in the field. A number of applications to several scientific and socioeconomic scenarios will conclude the theoretical course. Finally, a hands-on tutorial will allow the student to reach a working knowledge of all the material.
