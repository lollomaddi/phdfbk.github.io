research_topic: Design for Adaptation of Distributed Service-Based Systems
abstract: Internet of Services applications need to cope with a continuously changing environment, both in terms of the context in which they operate, and of the services, users and providers involved. In this setting, adaptivity is to be considered an intrinsic characteristic of applications rather than an exception to be handled. We propose a design for adaptation approach that fully exploits the advantages of the service-oriented paradigm to support the development and operation of service-based applications operating in highly dynamic environments. The approach is based on dynamic and incremental service composition and re-configuration techniques and it will be evaluated on a real-world scenario in the Smart Cities domain.
