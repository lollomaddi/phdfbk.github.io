abstract: Software systems are composed of multiple components. Components hold special privileges to perform different tasks. Controlled access to system resources is achieved through permission based security model. In order to gain privileges, a malicious component usually has to abuse a privileged component. This phenomenon is commonly known as the confused deputy attack. Confused deputy attack occurs when a privileged component performs an activity that needs special permission on behalf of other component that does not have the required permission. Static analysis is often used to detect existence of this vulnerability. However, reports of static analysis are vulnerability points rather than conditions that cause the vulnerability. Therefore, a developer that wishes to fix this vulnerability has to manually analyze the code in order to understand the conditions that cause the vulnerability. Similar to other permission based systems, the Android system also suffers from the confused deputy attack called permission redelegation. In our work, we investigate different approaches on how to automatically generate test cases that reveal permission redelegation vulnerabilities in Android apps. Test cases help developers easily trace, identify and fix the vulnerabilities. The test cases are also used to verify if the applied fix has resolved the vulnerability or not.
