aboutme: I joint FBK as a PhD student to pursue my interests in electrochemical energy conversion, solar fuel production and storage, and more generally exploitation of solar energy. My academic route maintains a strong link to the world of industry and engineering applications, with the aim of facilitating and encouraging the knowledge transfer between university and enterprises. In the ARES unit, I am currently working on the development of a Redox Flow Battery (RFB) based on the use of organic compounds.
