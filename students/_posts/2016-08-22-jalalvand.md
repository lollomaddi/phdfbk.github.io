abstract: The work on ASR quality estimation (ASR QE) has several motivations. First, the steady increase of applications involving automatic speech recognition (e.g. video/TV programs subtitling, voice search engines, voice question answering, spoken dialog systems, meeting and broadcast news transcriptions) calls for an accurate method to estimate ASR output quality at run-time. In this thesis, we study and design strategies for predicting the quality of ASR transcriptions from feature extraction to machine learning and applications.
