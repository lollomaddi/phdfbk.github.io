research_topic: Energy Efficient Heterogeneous Computing for smart wearable
abstract: Heterogeneous computing is the dominant megatrend in highperformance and mobile computing architecture. It is the second revolution, after the transition from single to multi-core, caused by the requirement for exponentially increasing energy efficiency, which cannot be met simply by technology scaling. The doctoral project will look into heterogeneous computing opportunities for ultra-low power platforms, such as those used for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The defining characteristic of these applications is that they must fit in a power envelope of a few tens of mW, which at least one order of magnitude lower than the target of current heterogeneous computing solutions.
