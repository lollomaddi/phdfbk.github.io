aboutme: My interest in computer science was born attending classes in the university. From the beginning I wanted to explore many aspects of this topic, motivated by willing classmates and professors. During several university projects I explored in particular embedded systems enhanced with distributed artificial intelligence techniques. Recently I became curious about the development of web and mobile applications and I decided to start a phd in web application testing. I like the exciting, dynamic and challenging environment offered by research, which lets me find out and learn something new every day. I am open to meeting new people with my same passion and thirst for knowledge; I like teamwork, collaboration and sharing of ideas and time.
