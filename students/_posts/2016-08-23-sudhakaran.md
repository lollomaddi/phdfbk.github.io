abstract: Multimedia content analysis more and more relies on advanced machine learning to capture the enormous richness of multi-modal sources (commented videos, images with captions, etc.). At the other side, domain specific knowledge is often available to leverage the content analysis task, but effectively encoding it into machine learning (down to the development of task-specific feature representations) is still an open research issue. The goal of this PhD is to progress on the computer vision side of the problem, to go beyond a mono-modal approach where supervisions for learning are provided explicitly. Instead, I will investigate how structured (background knowledge) and semi-structured data (e.g. text captions and descriptions) can be used to provide implicit supervision to enrich the task-specific visual learning capabilities.
