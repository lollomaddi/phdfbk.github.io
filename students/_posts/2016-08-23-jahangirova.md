research_topic: The Oracle Problem in Software Testing
abstract: The oracle problem remains one of the key challenges in software testing, for which little automated support has been developed so far. The effectiveness of a test case in revealing software faults depends critically on the quality of the oracle. My research is focused on the automated assessment and improvement of the oracle quality. The techniques proposed combine test case generation to reveal false positives, mutation testing to reveal false negatives and identification of the program points for internal oracle placement, which has the highest fault-finding capability
