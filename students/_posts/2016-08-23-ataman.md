research_topic: Flexible machine translation
abstract: Machine translation was mainly developed on the methodology where statistical machine-learning algorithms are applied on large sets of parallelized data in source and target languages. The current limitation of these methods is based on the nature of training data, which is not possible to contain all observations of expressions in the target language. Hence, the aim of the doctoral study is to investigate novel means by which generalization from limited space of observations might be performed and knowledge from human post-editions can be generalized to improve the quality of machine translation.
