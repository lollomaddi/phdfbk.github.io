research_topic: CMOS sensors for multi-spectral and multifunctional imaging beyond visible wavelengths
abstract: Silicon has demonstrated enormous potential for use as a visible light sensor. Nonetheless, it also demonstrated the ability to go further. Exploring and combining different detection principles in a single image sensor using integrated low noise electronics, is the purpose of this doctoral thesis. The activities will go through the study of the various detection principles, the potential applications, and the design and implementation of a multi-spectral and multifunctional CMOS image senso
