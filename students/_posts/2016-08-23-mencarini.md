research_topic: Haptic Feedback for Learning Sports
abstract: In my PhD project, I investigate the use of haptic feedback for learning sports. I consider climbing as case study, an extreme sport that requires both a high level of self-confidence and control over motor skills. By adopting research methods and practices of Interaction Design (such as Contextual Inquiry, Participatory Design, etc.), I aim at designing a valid device for the community of climbers and, at a broader level, to identify the communicative abilities of haptic feedback.
