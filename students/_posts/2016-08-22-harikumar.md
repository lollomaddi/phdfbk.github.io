abstract: Forests are an extremely important natural resource that need to be preserved for obvious environmental and economic reasons. An efficient forest management is essential for effective forest preservation. However such management demands an accurate inventory of biophysical parameters, such as the tree/crown height, the crown width, the biomass, which are costly to estimate by conducting on-site visits. In addition, the tree species information is also very essential for improving the accuracy of estimation. With the advancements in the airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) remote sensing technology, it has become possible to capture three dimensional (3D) information of forests at the individual tree level in a much reliable and economical way. The high density multi-return airborne LiDAR data can provide a huge amount of spatial details about forest components, and hence can be used for accurately extracting the tree crowns and species information, which can facilitate the ultimate objective of accurate biophysical parameter estimation. Accurate modelling of the internal crown structure of the tree is necessary for extracting species information. Also, the information in the LiDAR data can be better exploited for accurate biophysical parameter estimation, by developing novel methodologies which incorporate the ability of Sparse methods in finding the prominent patterns in the data. Thus, the overall objectives of this proposal are to: 1) develop methods for identifying the species of trees belonging to the same tree-genera using high density airborne LiDAR data, 2) develop novel methods for 3D tree crown delineation in high density multi-return airborne LiDAR data, and 3) develop fully automatic biophysical parameter estimation techniques, by giving special emphasis on exploiting the capabilities of Sparse methods.
