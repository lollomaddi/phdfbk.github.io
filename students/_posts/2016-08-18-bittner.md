aboutme: PhD candidate in Computer Science with proven ability of delivering solutions within ESA-funded projects, track record of publications in top-tier venues, and experience conceiving, designing, and implementing formal reasoning tools. Curious, passionate and goal-oriented, I do not shy away from a challenge.
from: Italy
research_topic: Formal verification and planning of Industrial Critical Systems
abstract: Co-financed by European Space Agency, including 10 month stay at ESA-ESTEC in Noordwijk / Netherlands.<br/>Safety-critical systems need to be able to deal with fault occurrences. Fault management functions embedded in the system are commonly referred to as FDIR - Fault Detection Isolation and Recovery.<br/><br/>Currently only little tool support exists to evaluate whether a given system design allows implementation of effective FDIR functions. Not only does this cause the creation of an unnecessarily complex and expensive FDIR system, it also doesn't allow to give formal justifications for FDIR effectiveness claims.<br/>The research focuses on the following two verification problems:<br/>+ Is reliable diagnosis of a given set of failures always possible? (diagnosability)<br/>+ Is it always possible to recover from a failure of interest? (recoverability)<br/><br/>Orthogonally I also investigate methods for timed failure propagation analysis to understand how failure modes and their effects can interact with each other over time and how they affect alarm signals. This can be integrated with diagnosability and recoverability analysis to improve performance, flexibility, and interpretability of results.
