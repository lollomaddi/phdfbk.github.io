abstract: My research is mainly focused on the study of opposition relations at lexical level as a source of contradiction at textual level. Detecting oppositions, both among words and among portions of text, is a fundamental requirement for text analysis. Indeed, textual opposition plays a crucial role in applications such as machine translation, discourse understanding, and information retrieval. In the first year, I have mainly focused the research on the study of opposition relation among verbs. I have studied opposition relation taking in consideration that i) opposition relation is among senses of verbs, and ii) there exist different types of opposition relation with different characteristics. The future steps of my research project aims at studying cases in which an opposition relation between two verbs lead to a contradiction among pairs of sentences. The study of contradiction also requires the analysis of the conditions in which this relation occurs, both at sentence and at text level. In fact, the presence of a lexical opposition alone is not a sufficient condition for contradiction to exist&#58; the opposite items need to be referred to the same entity/event. Consequently, for a complete study on contradiction, also co-reference need to be study from both a theoretical /linguistic and a computational point of view.
