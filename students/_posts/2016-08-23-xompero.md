research_topic: A Distributed Approach for Localization, Mapping and Object Tracking in Mobile Smart Camera Networks
abstract: Smart camera networks benefit from technological advances in sensing, processing and networking capabilities while offering novel opportunities in distributed computer vision research. Especially when people moving in a structured environment are to be monitored using wearable cameras and/or robotic platforms, the synergic collaboration among such devices exposes challenges to be further explored. This research will investigate opportunities of cooperative sensing and processing for real-time mapping, localisation and tracking in such contexts. The problem will be tackled with in a probabilistic framework with resource allocation capabilities to opportunistically manage the scalability-robustness trade-off. Performance assessment will itself require the definition of novel evaluation criteria.
