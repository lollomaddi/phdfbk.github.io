aboutme: My PhD project aims to propose new methods to virtually segment white matter tracts of interest in the human brain. We apply machine learning techniques to diffusion MRI data in order to obtain automatic segmentations from examples. My research interests include brain connectivity, neural networks, neuroimage analysis and signal processing.
