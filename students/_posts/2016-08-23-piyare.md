aboutme: Currently, I am working with some of the great minds in the area of Wireless Sensor Networks in Dynamic Distributed Decentralized Systems (D3S) group, a cross-institutional research group of University of Trento and Bruno Kessler Foundation. My research involves design and optimization of novel cross-layer MAC and Routing protocols for Ultra Low-Power Wake-up Radios to enable Low Energy Internet of Things (LE-IoT).

research_topic: Exploiting Ultra-low Power Wake-up Radios to enable Low Energy Internet of Things (LE-IoT)
abstract: Duty cycling Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols have been extensively applied in wireless sensor networks to reduce energy consumption by periodically putting the main radio into sleep mode. However, these protocols suffer from overhearing and idle listening causing considerable energy waste. This energy wastage can be greatly reduced by using a secondary ultra-low power wake-up radio to completely switch off the main radio and only wake it up when there is communication. To date, most effort has been devoted to the hardware level, but no consideration has been dedicated to the design of communication protocols based on wake-up radios. To exploit the full potential of wake-up radios, cross-layer integration at the higher level is required. My research work focuses on the design of novel wake-up radio MAC and Routing protocols with evaluation using test-beds and real-life deployments.
