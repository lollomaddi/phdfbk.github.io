aboutme: I received my  M.Tech. degree in Electrical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, India in 2014 where I researched on medical image processing. Following that, I worked as a computational nano mask technology engineer at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Taiwan (2015-2016). Currently I am a PhD student at Remote Sensing for Digital Earth (RSDE) group of FBK working under supervision of Francesca Bovolo and Lorenzo Bruzzone (University of Trento). I am researching on detection of changes from high resolution optical satellite images. Recently deep learning methods have exhibited state-of-the-art performance in many computer vision tasks. Taking that cue, I am investigating whether deep learning techniques can be exploited for remote sensing change detection.
