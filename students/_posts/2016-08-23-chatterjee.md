research_topic: Automatic Post-Editing for Machine Translation
abstract: Automatic Post-Editing (APE) aims at automatic correction of machine translation (MT) errors, as it is one of the major challenges posed by the evolution of translation industry. The goal is to advance the state-of-the-art in APE and set the conditions for fair, informative and comparable evaluations (with APE-specific metrics and shared reusable benchmarks). Particular emphasis will be placed on creating flexible systems, which are portable across language pairs and domains, and are capable to model and customize to users' style and needs
