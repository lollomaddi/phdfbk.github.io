aboutme: My name is Ahmed Irfan, and I am a PhD student in the ICT School at University of Trento (UniTN) and in the Embedded Systems (ES) group at Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK). I am advised by Alessandro Cimatti (ES, FBK) and co-advised by Roberto Sebastiani (DISI, UniTN). My research work is on formal verification of non-linear transition systems, in particular on abstraction techniques based on Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT). I also participate in the tool development of MathSAT, nuXmv, and Kratos.

abstract: Model Checking (MC) is a prominent technique for verifying reactive systems –both hardware and software systems. The presence of memory/array accesses in the systems under test, however, introduces many difficulties in current MC techniques. Although some work has been done to verify such systems by using MC techniques based on Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), there is still a big margin for improving efficiency. The goal of our research is to provide efficient SMT-based MC techniques for verifying reactive systems with memory/array accesses. We focus on adapting Verification Modulo Theories techniques –e.g. bounded model checking, k-induction, counter example guided abstraction refinement– and on improving the underlying SMT tools for handling memory/array.
