research_topic: Automated regulatory compliance checking of ABAC policies
abstract: Nowadays, most of business practices involve personal data processing of customers and employees. And personal data processing is strictly regulated by legislation to protect the rights of the personal data owner. Enforcing regulation into enterprise information system is a non-trivial task, and a misinterpretation can lead to sanctions. This research presents an automatic legal compliance verification method of attribute based access control (ABAC) against the EU Data Protection Directive (DPD) 95/46/EC. The rights, obligations and conditions for lawful personal data processing from the directive are extracted and mapped to a formal legal model. We use this model to check whether an enterprise access control policy complies or violates the regulation.
