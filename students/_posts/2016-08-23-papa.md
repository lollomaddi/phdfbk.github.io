research_topic: Communicating smart city&#58; big data visualization and communication models for citizen, citizen manager and others stakeholders.
abstract: The main focus of my PhD regards smart cities (Smart health)&#58; nowadays, the possibility to change something in a city is only managed in a qualitatively fashion; the most common way to obtain some information from citizens about their cities, is still done by means of questionnaires or by directly interviewing. We still have not a quantitatively feedback from people. Technological development, namely wearable systems, and fast computation make it possible to measure quantitatively the biological signals produced by the human body. The concept of the research project is not only based on the feedback from people, but also on the control of their state by measuring their physiological signals (ECG, EDA, etc...) to assess in everyday-life and in real time how they could be improved, in order to also improve their life quality. Combining these signals, we could potentially obtain a comprehensive and reliable description of physiological indices related to specific scenarios that could be exploited, in every moment, to model the citizen behavior. Once defined the most significant parameters and analyzed them through processing, it will be necessary to define and display the results in a simple and understandable way to all citizens&#58; the interaction between them and technological devices will be designed to be as easy as possible allowing people to react with fast and almost instantaneous changes. The data obtained will be accessible by users through user-friendly interfaces, which will not only allow an instant understanding of the values analyzed, but it could also lead to a new concept of smart city, from a static smart city (changes made after long periods) to a dynamic smart city (changes made in very short periods). The final goal of the PhD research project will be the development of guide protocols and a wearable equipment that can be used in all the cities, turning them into smart cities with a higher quality of life for the citizen.
