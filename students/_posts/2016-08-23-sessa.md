research_topic: Model-based design and planning in Plant Automation
abstract: Production plants are relevant examples of Cyber-Physical Systems where a complex engineered system is built from the seamless integration of computational algorithms and physical processes. Production plants present different challenges and needs. However, they share the need for technology that lowers the costs of design and verification, and optimizes the efficiency of production processes. This scenario provides the opportunity to satisfy such need through the development of a new generation of Planning Systems. The present research proposal aims to foster the joined application of Formal Verification (FV) and Temporal Planning in the Plant Automation domain leveraging the model-based approach.
