research_topic: Integrating logical and statistical reasoning
abstract: In image retrieval there is an emerging interest in searching images on the basis of semantic descriptions of their content&#58; for example searching for all the images that portray `a man riding a horse on a lawn`. Addressing this need requires (i) a language for describing image content and (ii) an automatic method to generate a description of such content. Our research proposes the use of ontologies in combination with machine learning to solve these problems. First, we explore the usage of ontological languages for expressing image content, which is represented as a partial model of an ontology. Second, we study the usage of ontology axioms, which impose constraints on image content, to improve the current image processing algorithms. Indeed, such algorithms are almost exclusively based on numerical methods, and integrating logical constraints in statistical algorithms is still an open problem. We therefore propose a novel method for combining logical reasoning with the processing of low-level image features, with the objective of improving the performance of current image interpretation systems.
