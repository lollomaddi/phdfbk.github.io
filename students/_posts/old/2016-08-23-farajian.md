abstract: I am currently working on online word alignment models for adaptive machine translation systems. The main challenges in our work are&#58; speed (both for training and test), accuracy of the alignments, and handling the new and infrequent words for which there is no reliable information in the system. We are also trying to apply our word alignment models on the domain adaptation of SMTs where the systems are trained on large general out of domain corpora and then have to be adapted to another domain with relatively very small training data.'advisor: Federico Marcello'keywords: human language technology, natural language processing, statistical machine translation, word alignment'website: https&#58;//hlt-mt.fbk.eu/people/profile/farajian
