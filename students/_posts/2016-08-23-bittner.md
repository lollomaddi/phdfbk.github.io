research_topic: Failure Propagation, Diagnosability, and Recoverability Analysis for safety-critical systems
abstract: In order to successfully implement failure management functions in safety-critical systems, corresponding formal failure propagation analysis methods and adequate V&V methods for the designs are fundamental. We propose a framework based on formal methods for timed failure propagation analysis, diagnosability analysis, and recoverability analysis, to be applied to design models of the system at hand.
