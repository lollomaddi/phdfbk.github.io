abstract: Tractograms of different brains need to be aligned in a common representation space for various purposes, such as group-analysis, segmentation or atlas construction. We investigate the registrationbased alignment and propose to improve it, by what we call mapping. We formulate the mapping problem as combinatorial optimization problem.
