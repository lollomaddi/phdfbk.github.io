aboutme: I come from Monte Santa Maria Tiberina, a small village between Umbria and Tuscany. I received my Bachelor degree in Computer and Electronic Engineering from University of Perugia in 2014, continuing my studies at University of Rome "La Sapienza", where I received my Master degree in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics in 2016.
from: Italy
research_topic: Local Deep Learning techniques for Scene Understanding
abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have shown to be very effective for addressing many computer vision tasks being the current state-of-the-art in object and scene recognition and semantic segmentation. In addition, their layers are able to create abstract images representation very effective as features, beating standard handcrafted approaches. However, there is still evidence that CNNs are not strong enough to tackle local variations and their training algorithms are not able to generalize enough to correctly address problems such as domain shift. My PhD goal is to exploit the CNNs power, together with the combination of local features, to clearly leverage the information coming from each part of the image, addressing tasks such as Scene Recognition and Understanding. The main idea is that not focusing on a single image representation helps building classifiers with enhanced generalization capabilities and increased power.
