We propose a design for adaptation approach that fully exploits the advantages of the service-oriented paradigm to support the development and operation of service-based applications operating in highly dynamic environments.

Demissie,Biniam Fisseha,University of Trento,,Ethiopia,Automatic Generation of Security Test Cases for Inter-Component Communication Vulnerabilities,"Software systems are composed of multiple components. Components hold special privileges to perform different tasks. Controlled access to system resources is achieved through permission based security model. In order to gain privileges, a malicious component usually has to abuse a privileged component. This phenomenon is commonly known as the confused deputy attack. Confused deputy attack occurs when a privileged component performs an activity that needs special permission on behalf of other component that does not have the required permission. Static analysis is often used to detect existence of this vulnerability. However, reports of static analysis are vulnerability points rather than conditions that cause the vulnerability. Therefore, a developer that wishes to fix this vulnerability has to manually analyze the code in order to understand the conditions that cause the vulnerability. Similar to other permission based systems, the Android system also suffers from the confused deputy attack called permission redelegation. In our work, we investigate different approaches on how to automatically generate test cases that reveal permission redelegation vulnerabilities in Android apps. Test cases help developers easily trace, identify and fix the vulnerabilities. The test cases are also used to verify if the applied fix has resolved the vulnerability or not.",Ceccato Mariano,"Software Engineering, security testing, android apps, software analysis, static analysis",https://se.fbk.eu/people/profile/demissie,demissie.jpg,demissie@fbk.eu

Donadello,Ivan,University of Trento,,Italy,Integrating logical and statistical reasoning,"In image retrieval there is an emerging interest in searching images on the basis of semantic descriptions of their content: for example searching for all the images that portray `a man riding a horse on a lawn`. Addressing this need requires (i) a language for describing image content and (ii) an automatic method to generate a description of such content. Our research proposes the use of ontologies in combination with machine learning to solve these problems. First, we explore the usage of ontological languages for expressing image content, which is represented as a partial model of an ontology. Second, we study the usage of ontology axioms, which impose constraints on image content, to improve the current image processing algorithms. Indeed, such algorithms are almost exclusively based on numerical methods, and integrating logical constraints in statistical algorithms is still an open problem. We therefore propose a novel method for combining logical reasoning with the processing of low-level image features, with the objective of improving the performance of current image interpretation systems.",Serafini Luciano,"Semantic image interpretation, knowledge extraction, deep learning, semantic clustering",https://dkm.fbk.eu/people/profile/donadello,donadello.jpg,donadello@fbk.eu

Detecting oppositions, both among words and among portions of text, is a fundamental requirement for text analysis. Indeed, textual opposition plays a crucial role in applications such as machine translation, discourse understanding, and information retrieval. In the first year, I have mainly focused the research on the study of opposition relation among verbs. I have studied opposition relation taking in consideration that i) opposition relation is among senses of verbs, and ii) there exist different types of opposition relation with different characteristics. The future steps of my research project aims at studying cases in which an opposition relation between two verbs lead to a contradiction among pairs of sentences. The study of contradiction also requires the analysis of the conditions in which this relation occurs, both at sentence and at text level. In fact, the presence of a lexical opposition alone is not a sufficient condition for contradiction to exist: the opposite items need to be referred to the same entity/event. Consequently, for a complete study on contradiction, also co-reference need to be study from both a theoretical /linguistic and a computational point of view.",Magnini Bernardo,"Lexical Studies, Natural language Processing, Human Language Technology",https://hlt-nlp.fbk.eu/people/profile/feltracco,feltracco.jpg,feltracco@fbk.eu

Harikumar,Aravind,University of Trento,,India,Remote sensing for environmental monitoring,"Forests are an extremely important natural resource that need to be preserved for obvious environmental and economic reasons. An efficient forest management is essential for effective forest preservation. However such management demands an accurate inventory of biophysical parameters, such as the tree/crown height, the crown width, the biomass, which are costly to estimate by conducting on-site visits. In addition, the tree species information is also very essential for improving the accuracy of estimation. With the advancements in the airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) remote sensing technology, it has become possible to capture three dimensional (3D) information of forests at the individual tree level in a much reliable and economical way. The high density multi-return airborne LiDAR data can provide a huge amount of spatial details about forest components, and hence can be used for accurately extracting the tree crowns and species information, which can facilitate the ultimate objective of accurate biophysical parameter estimation. Accurate modelling of the internal crown structure of the tree is necessary for extracting species information. Also, the information in the LiDAR data can be better exploited for accurate biophysical parameter estimation, by developing novel methodologies which incorporate the ability of Sparse methods in finding the prominent patterns in the data. Thus, the overall objectives of this proposal are to: 1) develop methods for identifying the species of trees belonging to the same tree-genera using high density airborne LiDAR data, 2) develop novel methods for 3D tree crown delineation in high density multi-return airborne LiDAR data, and 3) develop fully automatic biophysical parameter estimation techniques, by giving special emphasis on exploiting the capabilities of Sparse methods.",Bovolo Francesca,"Remote Sensing, Airborne Laser Scanner, LiDAR, Tree Species detection, Biophysical parameter estimation, modelling",https://rsde.fbk.eu/people/profile/harikumar,harikumar.jpg,harikumar@fbk.eu

Merzi ,Stefano,University of Trento,,Italy,Application of novel position-sensitive Silicon PhotoMultipliers to medical imaging,"The Silicon Photo-multiplier (SiPM) is replacing the photomultiplier tube in several applications because of its solid-state nature, its better performance and customization level. Different position-sensitive SiPM (PS-SiPM) architectures have been proposed during the past few years. They allow the position of the light impinging on the SiPM active area to be identified using a limited number of readout channels, with an ultimate precision in the order of tens of microns and a sensitivity down to the single photon. The most important applications of PS-SiPMs are currently in the field of medical imaging, in which a scintillator is used for the detection of gamma-ray or X-ray photons. The PS-SiPM is used for the readout of the pixelated or monolithic scintillator with 2-dimensional position sensitivity and very good timing resolution. In this context, FBK has recently developed a new type of PS-SiPM, called Lineraly-Graded SiPM (LG-SiPM), showing beyond stateof-the-art performance during preliminary measurements. The PhD activity will focus on the research and development optimization of this technology, aiming at improving its performance and at extending its potential applications, within the current research programs of TIFPA and FBK.",Alberto Gola,"SiPM, position-sensitive, medical imaging",,merzi.jpg,smerzi@fbk.eu

Papa,Lorenzo,University of Padova,,Italy,"Communicating smart city: big data visualization and communication models for citizen, citizen manager and others stakeholders.","The main focus of my PhD regards smart cities (Smart health): nowadays, the possibility to change something in a city is only managed in a qualitatively fashion; the most common way to obtain some information from citizens about their cities, is still done by means of questionnaires or by directly interviewing. We still have not a quantitatively feedback from people. Technological development, namely wearable systems, and fast computation make it possible to measure quantitatively the biological signals produced by the human body. The concept of the research project is not only based on the feedback from people, but also on the control of their state by measuring their physiological signals (ECG, EDA, etc...) to assess in everyday-life and in real time how they could be improved, in order to also improve their life quality. Combining these signals, we could potentially obtain a comprehensive and reliable description of physiological indices related to specific scenarios that could be exploited, in every moment, to model the citizen behavior. Once defined the most significant parameters and analyzed them through processing, it will be necessary to define and display the results in a simple and understandable way to all citizens: the interaction between them and technological devices will be designed to be as easy as possible allowing people to react with fast and almost instantaneous changes. The data obtained will be accessible by users through user-friendly interfaces, which will not only allow an instant understanding of the values analyzed, but it could also lead to a new concept of smart city, from a static smart city (changes made after long periods) to a dynamic smart city (changes made in very short periods). The final goal of the PhD research project will be the development of guide protocols and a wearable equipment that can be used in all the cities, turning them into smart cities with a higher quality of life for the citizen.",Pistore Marco,Interacting with smart cities.,http://hit.psy.unipd.it/lorenzo-papa,,lorenzo.papa89@gmail.com

Pirrone,Davide,University of Trento,,Italy,Change detection methodologies for multi-temporal SAR images,"In the remote sensing, modern Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems have capabilities of acquiring data raising spatial resolution to sub-meter level and/or controlling the wave polarization of both transmitted and received waves. These represent a powerful tool for the multi-temporal analysis of changes in natural and urban areas. If we consider urban areas, SAR image potential in the analysis of small changes (i.e., smaller than the building size) is not fully exploited yet. These changes are associated to specific patterns of amplitude backscattering variation, if we consider same polarization for the incident and the scattered wave; or other parameter, if we consider data with multiple polarization. Thus, my research activity aims at developing backscattering models for changes affecting parts of the buildings (i.e., the roof or one of the façades) It also aims at designing novel advanced methodologies for the detection of changes in multi-temporal SAR images, which exploits the information from the higher level of detail and the different combinations of wave polarization.",Bovolo Francesca,"Remote Sensing, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Change Detection, Multi-temporal image analysis, Image Processing",https://it.linkedin.com/in/davide-pirrone-41aa552b,pirrone.jpg,pirrone@fbk.eu

However, these protocols suffer from overhearing and idle listening causing considerable energy waste. This energy wastage can be greatly reduced by using a secondary ultra-low power wake-up radio to completely switch off the main radio and only wake it up when there is communication. To date, most effort has been devoted to the hardware level, but no consideration has been dedicated to the design of communication protocols based on wake-up radios. To exploit the full potential of wake-up radios, cross-layer integration at the higher level is required.

The improvement in acquisition sensor technology as well as in the data processing algorithm allowed an accurate and automatic identification and extraction of characteristics for the understanding of the environmental changes, especially while working with Very High Resolution (VHR) information. Nevertheless, the revisit of the sensors, the competing orders, and the weather conditions do not always allow the acquisition of proper and relevant information. To mitigate these limitations it is possible to construct time series by considering images acquired by different sensors. The main constraint becomes how to deal with this kind of information. Therefore, in this research we aim at developing an approach for the detection of changes in multisensor multitemporal VHR optical images by following two main steps: i) multi-sensor data homogenization; and ii) change detection for the analysis in multisensor multitemporal VHR images.",Bovolo Francesca,Image Processing Pattern recognition Remote sensing image analysis,https://rsde.fbk.eu/people/profile/solano,solano.jpg,solano@fbk.eu
