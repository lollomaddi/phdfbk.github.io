research_topic: Energy Efficient Embedded Digital Architectures
abstract: Wireless embedded systems are shaping a new era of smart everything everywhere. New devices are entering in our daily lives contributing to novel scenarios where their co-existence opens opportunities for usersâ€™ quality of life. Still old and novel challenges lies ahead. Wearables for Health and professional sport encounters the trade-off between energy efficiency, form factor at one side and the QoS and the human factors at the other. Moreover, their massive distribution pose challenges on their scalability, co-existence and cooperation. In this research, these challenges will be considered under the energy efficiency umbrella.
