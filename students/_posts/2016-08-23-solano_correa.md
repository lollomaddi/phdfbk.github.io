research_topic: Advanced Methods for the Analysis of Very High Resolution Multi-Sensor Optical Images Time-Series
abstract: The use of remote sensing in the analysis and evaluation of environmental degeneration processes has become a valuable tool which relevance increased in conjunction with the use of digital image processing techniques. The improvement in acquisition sensor technology as well as in the data processing algorithm allowed an accurate and automatic identification and extraction of characteristics for the understanding of the environmental changes, especially while working with Very High Resolution (VHR) information. Nevertheless, the revisit of the sensors, the competing orders, and the weather conditions do not always allow the acquisition of proper and relevant information. To mitigate these limitations it is possible to construct time series by considering images acquired by different sensors. The main constraint becomes how to deal with this kind of information. Therefore, in this research we aim at developing an approach for the detection of changes in multisensor multitemporal VHR optical images by following two main steps: i) multi-sensor data homogenization; and ii) change detection for the analysis in multisensor multitemporal VHR images.
