abstract: Various health risks are related to unhealthy lifestyles and poor dietary habits. A number of pathologies due to these health risk behaviors represent a serious challenge, resulting in disabling or life-threatening repercussions. People struggle to adhere to dietary requirements, exercise, and lifestyle recommendations. Additionally, decreased motivation results in a probability of negative health implications. This study evaluates existing technologies used to have users adhere to sustained healthy behavior. We investigate persuasive technology and gamification strategies to reinforce users in exercising and healthy food substitution. We intend to develop a model to be used in creating-producing widgets to persuade people change their lifestyle. Subsequently, our model facilitates a sustained diet management plan supported by healthcare experts to intervene in the activity, only when necessary.
