aboutme: I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Trento. By joining the ICT doctoral school program in 2014, I became a research fellow member of ICT4G research unit inside Fondazione Bruno Kessler FBK, Trento - Italy. At the same time, I was partially funded by CRG - Centro Ricerche GPI. I acquired my Master degree in 2014 from the university of Trento, and with a focus on semantic web and NLP. My Master of science in Computer science was titled "A semantic matching via web". Before all these, I earned my Bachelor (with high honours) in Information Technology in 2012 from Eastern Mediterranean University EMU - Cyprus. I earned a scholarship grand offered by the Cypriot government. My research aims to identify the correlation between diet and chronic diseases, and applying multidisciplinary research to promote healthy diet and lifestyle. I am researching motivational techniques, such as gamification and persuasive technologies to engage users in self-monitoring their condition. Additionally, I am also conducting research on AI and applying conversational UIs as a tool in preventive healthcare and quantified-self. My PhD research is specifically focused on diet management, quantified-self and prevention from chronic disease.

abstract: Various health risks are related to unhealthy lifestyles and poor dietary habits. A number of pathologies due to these health risk behaviors represent a serious challenge, resulting in disabling or life-threatening repercussions. People struggle to adhere to dietary requirements, exercise, and lifestyle recommendations. Additionally, decreased motivation results in a probability of negative health implications. This study evaluates existing technologies used to have users adhere to sustained healthy behavior. We investigate persuasive technology and gamification strategies to reinforce users in exercising and healthy food substitution. We intend to develop a model to be used in creating-producing widgets to persuade people change their lifestyle. Subsequently, our model facilitates a sustained diet management plan supported by healthcare experts to intervene in the activity, only when necessary.
