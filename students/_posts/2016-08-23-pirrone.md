research_topic: Change detection methodologies for multi-temporal SAR images
abstract: In the remote sensing, modern Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems have capabilities of acquiring data raising spatial resolution to sub-meter level and/or controlling the wave polarization of both transmitted and received waves. These represent a powerful tool for the multi-temporal analysis of changes in natural and urban areas. If we consider urban areas, SAR image potential in the analysis of small changes (i.e., smaller than the building size) is not fully exploited yet. These changes are associated to specific patterns of amplitude backscattering variation, if we consider same polarization for the incident and the scattered wave; or other parameter, if we consider data with multiple polarization. Thus, my research activity aims at developing backscattering models for changes affecting parts of the buildings (i.e., the roof or one of the fa√ßades) It also aims at designing novel advanced methodologies for the detection of changes in multi-temporal SAR images, which exploits the information from the higher level of detail and the different combinations of wave polarization.
