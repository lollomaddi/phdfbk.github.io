research_topic: Sensorial Association of the words and its effects on Figurative Language
abstract: To tackle the semantics of figurative language, several conceptual properties such as concreteness or imegeability are employed. However, there is no attempt in the literature to analyze and benefit from the sensorial elements for figurative language processing. In this thesis, the impact of sensorial features on metaphor processing is investigated.
