research_topic: Natural language processing and production of persuasive messages
abstract: Influencing people's attitudes and behavior is an important feature for intelligent communication systems. However, few systems tackled this problem in the field of Natural Language Generation, and mostly with an approach based on argumentation. Very few have dealt with the so called peripheral route, which relies instead on evocative and attention grabbing expressions. In particular, their resulting text is often deemed uncreative and repetitive by users. The goal of my research is to define a simple persuasion framework, and to use it for the development of a complex system that starts from a human-produced short text and modifies it to be more persuasive, avoiding the pitfalls of traditional NLG. To experiment with this concept in applied domains I also plan to develop prototypes for specific persuasive applications
