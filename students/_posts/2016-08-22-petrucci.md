research_topic: Information Extraction for Learning Expressive Ontologies
abstract: Ontologies are used to represent knowledge in a formal and unambiguous way, facilitating its reuse and sharing among people and computer systems. A large amount of knowledge is traditionally available in unstructured text sources and manually encoding their content into a formal representation is costly and time-consuming. Several methods have been proposed to support ontology engineers in the ontology building process, but they mostly turned out to be inadequate for building rich and expressive ontologies. In my research activities, I exploit the recent advances in Neural Networks research tailoring them to fit the ontology learning problem.
